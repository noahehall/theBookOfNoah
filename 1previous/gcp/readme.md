    - measured service: pay only for what you use
  - virtualization: managing services separately from the hardware
  - GCP Computing Architectures
    - IaaS: infrastructure as a service
      - provide raw, compute, storage, and network
      - you pay for what you allocate
      - e.g. compute engine

    - applications that significantly or fully incorporate third party, cloud-hosted applications and services to manage server-side logic and state
    - applications where server-side logic is written by the application developer, but run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral and fully managed by a third party
    - you dont have to provision compute instances to run your jobs
  - integrated platform: products on the platform can seamlessly commmunicate with eachother
  - stream analytics: stream processing analyzes and performs actions on real-time data through the use of continuous queries
    - connects to external data sources, enabling applications to integrate certain data into th eapplication flow, or to update an external database with processed information
  - pub/sub model:
    - pub: the publisher who posts messages to specific topics
    - sub: the subscriber who listens for messages about specific topics
    - push vs pull
      - push: subscribers are pushed messages when they arrive
      - pull: subscribes poll/check for new messages at arbitrary intervals
  - metadata: information that describes data
  - database architectures
    - relational:
      - use metadata to provide information about the data source, data collection methods, and meaning
      - tabular structure keeps data well organized and accessible
      - exact kind and quanitity of data is always known
    - NoSQL
      - dont use normalized data model found in dbs,
        - dont organize data in tables, rows and columns
      - use cases
        - data has little/inconsistent structure
        - data must be distributed across more than one emachine
        - speed is more important than accuracy
        - application requires data types or analysis methods that common relational dbs handle poorly
      - types

        - XML: native XML db or native XML dbms
          - data in xml format or varied copmlex formats like audio or video
  - setting up your environment
    - imperative approach: figure out the commands you need to setup/change from the old state to the new
    - declarative: use a template to specify what the environment should look like
	- strongly consistent: when you perform an operation and receive a success response, the object is immediately available
	- eventually consistent: when you perform an operation, the effect is not immediately available
	- truncated exponential backoff: error handling strategy for networking applications
		- a client periodically retries failed requests with increasing delays between requests
	- hot keys: situations where proportionately large chunks of your input get mapped to the same cluster in a distributed system
    - e.g. in map/reduce transformations

# Best Practices
  - Cloud Native Application Goals
    - global reach and can handle high traffic volumes reliably
    - scalability
    - high availability
    - security
    - loosely coupled
    - resiliency
    - repeatable & rollbackable deployments
    - build and release systems that enable continuous integration and delivery
    - debugging, monitoring and performance-tuning are crucial for running robust applications
  - understand your data storage needs to and storage options
    - storage needs
      - high volumes of flat structured data
      - relational data
      - multimedia
  - interleaved ttable: a table that you declare to be a child of another table you want the rows of the child table to be physically stored together with the associated parent row

## app code and environment
  - code repository
    - all code should be stored in a repository
    - enables you to track changes and setup systems for continuous integration and delivery
  - use a dependency manager
    - this allows you to never store external packages in your repository
    - each version of your application should explicity list its dependencies
  - configuration settings
    - separate config settings from coder
    - never store config settings as constants
    - specify config settings as env variables
      - allows you to easily modify settings in differeent environments

## Microservices Architecture
  - enables you to structure your application in relation to your business boundaries
  - designed for loosely coupled services
    - this makes them resiliant to spikes, failures, and changes to traffic (load)
    - use pub/sub model
      - a cloud pub/sub topic can be the message queue
        - enabling perform asynchronous processing, and buffer requests during spikes in traffic
    - consumers of HTTP apis should bind loosely with publisher payloads
      - never attempt to bind with all fields in the payload
      - this enables the publisher to modify the API in a backwards compatibld manner
  - implement stateless components for scalability
    - never store state internally or access shared state
      - shared states are a common bottleneck for scalability
    - each component should focus on compute tasks only
      - enables you to implement the worker pattern in order to add/remove additional instances of the component for scalability
    - components should startup & shutdown quickly to enable efficient scaling
  - cache application data/content
    - improves performance and lowers network latency
    - anything that is computationally intensive to calculate
    - anything that is frequently accessed
    - never cache private/personal data
    - always follow modern cache strategies
    - store data in a cache service like memcached/redis
    - store webpages/static content in a CDN
  - each service is monitored and can fail gracely on error
  - each service lives as a distinct application that can be updated, deployed and scaled indepdendently of each other
    - perfect for handling feature changes and bug fixes
  - far more easier to understand where code needs to be changed compared to a monolithic application
  - each service has distinct dependencies (vs the tangled dependencies in large monoliths)
  - things to watch out for
    - remote operations can be unpredictable and response times can make your app seem slow
      - keep ui responsive
      - always perform backend operations asynchronously
      - keep operations on the user thread at a minimum
      - use event-driven processing where possible
  -

## API Gateways
  - enables backend functionality to be available to consumer applications
  - if your backend cannot be moved to the cloud
    - the API can still serve as a facade or adapter link instead of communicating with the legacy backend using outdated protocols or desparate interfaces
      - each consumer can then invoke a modern cloud API which then invokes the legacy backend

## External User Administration
  - use federated identity management
    - minimizes effort for user administration
  - whether using FIM or building inhouse, always:
    - implement secure solution for authenticating & authorizing users
    - use strong cryptographic hash for passwords
    - allow for third party identity providers
    - separate the concept of user identity and user account
      - users are not an email address, phone number, etc.
      - users are a columnation of their unique personalized data and experience within your service
    - maintain low coupling and high cohesion between different parts of a user's profile
    - allow multiple identities to link to a single user account
    - don't block long/complex passwords
    - don't impose unreasonable ruules for usernames
    - allow users to change their username
    - permit users to delete their accounts
    - make a consious decision on session length
    - use 2-step verification
    - make user IDs case insensitive
    - build a secure auth system

## Application Reliability
### health-check endpoints
  - monitor the status of your app and services via a Health Monitoring Agent (e.g. a load balancer)
    - periodically sends requests tot he health check endpoint
  - ensure they are available and performing optimally
  - setup alerts to devOps at thresholds
  - the health-check handler should check the health of:
    - all critical dependencies
      - storage
      - database
      - network connections
      - etc
    - all infrastructure components required for the service to function properly
### Logging
  - monitoring your app's performance
    - debugging
    - error reporting
    - tracing
    - logs-based metrics
    - monitoring
  - treat your logs as event streams: logs constitute a continous stream of events that keep occuring as long as the app is running
  - never manage your log files in your application
    - write to an event stream, e.g. standard out and let the underlying infrastructure collate all events for later analysis and storage
  - setup logs-baased metrics and trace requests across different services in you rapplication
### error handling
  - handle transient and long-lasting errors gracefully
  - transient errors: retry with exponential backoff
  - service availability errors: implement a circuit breaker
  - each UI component should degrade gracefully
  - for errors that propagate back to the user
    - consider degrading the application gracefully instead of explicity displaying the error message
      - this can help with security
### Testing
  - setup high availability tests
  - setup functional tests
  - setup performance tests
  - setup tabletop tests
    - teams discuss how they will respond in failure scenarios but dont perform any real actions
  - setup canary testing
  - identify failure scenarios and simulate them in your development environment to test the efficacy of your disaster recovery plans
    - connectivity failiure
    - on-premises data center / other cloud provider failure
    - zone/region failure
    - deployment rollback
    - data corruption caused by network / application issues
  - develop disaster recovery plans
    - people are notified
    - traffic is rerouted using redundant routes
    - make sure data was not corrupted during failure & recovery process
    - ensure all services/processes are restored ina timely manner
    - processes
    - tools

## DevOps
  - devops model
    - should be fullly automated
    - continouosly integrated
    - continuously deployed
  - code repo -> build system -> deploy system ->
    - test environments: execute integration, security, and performance tests
    - production environment: monitor performance with metrics and alerts
  - integrate and deliver small changes vs big changes
    - lowers risk of regression
    - debug issues faster
    - rollback to the last stable build
### SecDevOps
  - consider security throughout the continuous integration and delivery process
  - automate security checks
    - confirm your using the most secure version of third party dependencies
    - scan code for security vulnerabilities
    - confirm resources have permissions based on principle of least privilege
    - detecting errors in production

## Application Security
### Data
  - data sovereignty
    - some regions and industry segments have strict compliance requirements for data protection and consu mer privacy
    - Areas to consider
      - processing user data
      - storing user data
      - sharing user data
      - review the industry segment and region where your users live and your services will be located

## Migrating to the cloud
  - implement the strangler pattern: incremently replace components of the old application with new services
    -

# GCP PRODUCTS

## development
### cloud source repositories (i.e. git)
    - keep code private to a GCP project
    - IAM permissions used to protect the code
    - fully featured git repositories
    - source viewer: browser and view repo files within the GCP console
    - allow external users
  - supported platforms
### cloud functions
    - create single-purpose functions that respond to events without a server/runtime
    - written in javascript, execute in managed node.js environment on GCP
    - triggers
      - you choose what events you care about
      - you attach javascript functions to your event triggers
      - supported platforms
        - cloud storage events
        - cloud pub/sub events
        - http calls
    - use cases
      - breakapart an existing monolithic application into microservices with little developer effort
      - enhance existing applications without having to worry about scaling
      - enhance an event-driven application without having to provision additional compute resources
    - cost
      - pay when function runs in 100ms intervals

## deployment
	- reliable services require reliable release processes
	- automate build test and release processes
	- build pipelines: use container registry + builder
	- continuous integration:
		- code: frequently pull from master branch and commit changes to a feature branch in a repo (github/cloud source repository)
		- build: commit triggers (jenkins/circleci) a build and stores a new application image (container builder) and stores it in an artifact repository (container registry)
		- deploy: deployment system (spinnaker, chef, puppet, ansible, terraform) deploys the artifact(s) in your cloud environment
			- deployment manager stands up any resources your application needs
		- test: your application is now running and you can test
			- if tests are successful merge your changes back into master
	- continuous delivery: triggered when changes are pushed to master repository
		- code
		- build
		- deploy: (this time to staging)
		- test: if all tests pass then the build is tagged as a release candidate build
			- successful builds are marked as release candidates
		- release: release candidate approvals can trigger automatic deployment as a canary or blue/green release
		- monitor: monitor (stackdriver) production environment and switch over entire traffic to this release or rollback to last stable release
	- continous deployment: automatically deploys release candidates to production environment
### deployment manager
  - infrastructure as code
  - automates the creation and management of your GCP resources via templates
  - you can version control your templates in cloud source repos
  - workflow
    - create a template file in YAML/Python that describes what you want the components of your environment to look like
    - deployment manager executes your template to create the environment described
    - to make changes, edit the template and deployment manager will update your environment automatically
### cloud container registry
	- container image: complate package that contains the app binary and software required for the app to run
		- you should deploy the same container image to all your environments to ensure you app performs correctly
	- create build triggers for trigger types for building different types of artifacts
		- trigger type: specifies whether builds should be triggered by commits to which branch / tag
		- build configuration yaml/json file: specifies the steps in the build pipeline
			- steps: each step is a docker container that is invoked by container builder when the build is executed; analogous to cmd/scripts executed to build the application
				- name: identifies the continer to invoke for that build step
					- e.g. gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
				- images: the name of the container image to be created by this build configuration
					- e.g. gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cd-demo-img
	- triggers new builds in container builder

### cloud container builder
	- fully managed service to setup build pipelines
		- create a docker container image for application and push it to cloud container registry
	- workflow
		- retrieves source code and build configuration from repo
		- pushes new container image to container registry
	-
## monitoring
  - you cant run an application stably without monitoring
  - use cases
    - understanding if the changes made good / bad ?
    - respond with information vs panic when end-users complain
### Stackdriver
  - insight into your applications health, performance and availability, diagnostics, and various other metrics
  - gives you access to many signals:
    - infrastructure platforms
    - virtual machines
    - containers
    - middleware
    - application tier
  - core components
    - monitoring: checks the endpoints of applications and other internet accessible services running in GCP
      - platform, system and application metrics
      - uptime/health checks: associated with URLS, groups, or resources
      - alerts: on any criteria/condition and integration with popular notification tools
      - dashboards: visualize state of app
    - logging: view logs from applications
      - define metrics based on log content
      - export to bigquery, cloud storage, and cloud pubsub
      - platform, system, and application logs
      - log search, view, filter, and export
    - error reporting: tracks and groups errors in cloud applications and notifies you when new errors are detected
      - error notifications
      - error dashboard
    - debugging: connects your application's production data to your source code for you to inspect the state of your app at any code location in production
      - view the app state without adding logging statements
      - works best when your app source code is available
        - cloud source repos
        - other repos
    - Trace: sample the latency of app engine applications and report per-url statistics
      - latency reporting and sampling
      - per-url latency and statistics
  -

# GCP Platform Administration
  - principal of least privilege: users only receive permissions to do what they are required to do

## Managing resources
### Web Console:
  - web based admin
    - view and manage projects and their resources
    - enable and disable and explore API of GCP resources
  - API Explorer: testing google cloud APIs in a sandbox
#### Cloud Shell:
  - CLI to access GCP resources from your browser
    - built-in authorization to cloud platofrm console proejcts and resources
    -
  - a temp VM instance
    - 5gb of persistent disk
    - pre-intsalled google cloud sdk
  - features
    - web preview: start a web browser on an arbitrary port to the connected resource
    - built-in code editor
### Google Cloud SDK:
  - manage resources and applications, is available as a docker image
    - useful for writing scripts
  - has 3 tools
    - gcloud: all services except cloud storage and bq
      - perform common tasks on GCP
      - create and manage GCP resources
      - script/automate gcloud commands
      - use gcloud interactive shell
    - gsutil: for cloud storage
      - create and manage buckets
      - upload, download and delete objects
      - move, copy and rename objects
      - manage access to stored objects
    - bq: BigQuery
      - manage datasets, tables, and other BigQuery entities
      - allows you to run queries
### Google API client library:
  - should only be used if your programming language does not have a a Google Client Library
    - does not support gRPC
    - use JSON as an interchange format
    - uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization
    - each API is enabled through console
    - include daily quotas and rates that can be raised by request
    - API Explorer: interactive tool to easily try google APIs using a browser
      - see Docs
      - execute requests for any method and see responses in real time
      - make authenticated and authorized API calls
### Cloud Client Libraries:
  - API Client libraries: open source generated supporting various languages
    - handle low level communication with the server, including authentication with google
    - installed using familiar package managers
    - provide retry login for failed requests automatically
    - gRPC: google remote procedure call APIs
      - makes it easier to build connected systems by enabling client and server applications to communicate transparently
      - makes it
  - recommended method to invoke google cloud API
  - architecture
    - every package uses a client as a base for interacting with an API
      - authentication
        - if your app is on app/compute engine authentication will just work
        - if you dont explicitly provide credentials, the client will reuse the credentials from the gcloud tool if it has already been setup
        -
### Mobile App
    - manage virtual machines and DB instances
    - manage apps in google app engine
    - manage billing
    - visualize projects via customizable dashboards

## GCP Regions and Zones
  - Zone: deployment area for GCP resources like a VM in Compute Engine
    - you generally spread resources across multiple zones in a region to build a fault tolerant application to protect against unexpected failures
    - e.g. europe-west2-a
  - Regions: independent geographic areas
    - all zones in tbe same region have fast network latencies under 5 ms
    - Multi-region: storing your data in multiple regions for redundancy

## resource hierarchy:
  - policies can be defined at each level
  - policies are inherited downward
    1. org node: the top node that allows you to have visibility into all of your folders and projects
    2. folders: groups projects into logical units
    3. projects: organize your resources, and group resources that have a common business objective
      - all GCP resources belong to a project
      - are the basis for enabling and using GCP services like APIs, billing, collaborates, etc
      - each project is a separate compartment
      - billed separately and managed separately
      - identifying a project
        - ID: immutable & globally unique and chosen by you
        - name: mutable & chosen by you
        - number: immutable globally unique and chosen by GCP
    4. resources: e.g. storage, VM
      - inherit policies of their parent resource
      - parent policies cant take away access thats granted at a lower level

## IAM: Cloud Identity and Access Management
  - IAM: manage access control by defining WHO (members) has ACCESS (roles) to  WHAT (resources)
  - best practices
	  - always use the principle of least privilege
	  - use external keys for use from outside GCP
		  - you are responsible for the security of the private key and other management operations such as key rotation
		  - manage via: IAM API, gcloud CLI, service accounts page in GCP Console
	  - use API keys for GCP APIs that do not need to access private user data
		  - browser/mobile apps that dont have a backend server
		  - used to track API requests associated with your project for quota and billing
	  - service accounts:
			- for authenticating to a GCP API so users aren't directly involved
		  - represent each microservice by its own distinct service account

### OAuth 2.0
	  - your app needs to access data that belongs to a user
	  - your app needs to authenticate as a user to act on their behalf
		- steps
			1. your app requests access to the resource
			2. the user will be prompted for consent
			3. the app will request creds from an authorization server
			4. the app will then use those creds to access the resources on behalf of the user
	  -
### IAP: Cloud identity-aware proxy
	- controls access to your cloud apps running on GCP
		- apps and resources protected by IAP can only be accessed via the proxy by users and groups with the correct cloud IAM role
		- verifies a user's identity without requiring a VPN
		- determines whether that user should be allowed access to the app
		- end users use a URL to access IAP secured apps without a VPN
	- flow:
		- users request resource
		- routed to IAP proxy
			- authenticate: identity verified
			- authorize: roles + permission to access resource
			- identify not verified
	- Best practices
		- configure your firewalla nd load balancer to protect against traffic that doesnt come from the serving infrastructure
		- use signed headers or the app engine standard environment users API
	- use cases
		- establish a central authorization layer for your apps accessed by HTTPS
		- adopt an application level access control model instead of relying on network level firewalls
### firebase sdk for authentication
	- google's federated authentication supporting end user signin at the client app using third-party creds (e.g. google/facebook)
  - firebase: mobile and web app dev platform
    - ios, android, web, c++, unity, nodejs
   - flow
	   - get auth creds from the user
	   - pass the creds to firebase authentication sdk
	   - firebase backend services verify creds and return a response to the client
	   - after successfuly sign in
		   - access users profile
		   - control the users access to data stored in other firebase products
		   - use provided auth token to verify identify of users in your own backend services
   - cost
	   - price
		   - spark plan: free
		   - flame plan 25/month
		   - blaze plan: pay as you go
	   - auth
		   - spark plan: free
		   - flame plan: free
		   - blaze plan: free
	   - phone auth
		   - spark plan: 10k auth/month
		   - flame: 10k auth/month
		   - blaze: 0.01/verification (use, canada, india) 0.06 (all other countries)
  - use cases
    - implement federated identity management with firebase authentication
    - firebase sdk for cloud storage stores files directly in google cloud storage buckets
    - use app engine api to share data between firebase and app engine
    - cloud functions for firebase lets you run backend code in respond to events triggered by firebase features and http requests
    -
### IAM Members: The WHO
	- ADC: application default credentials
  - types
    1. a google account or cloud identity users e.g. blah@gmail.com
	    - a developer, administrator, or a person who interactions with GCP
		2. a google service account: provision an ID to control server-to-server interactions in a project
			- belong to an app/VM
			- identified by a unique email address
			- associated with a key pair
			- supported by all GCP APIs
			- authentication:
		    - use cryptographic keys
		    - can be assigned custom or predefine roles
		  - identified by an email address
		    - PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
		    - PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
			- steps
				1. create service account via console
				2. generate and download cred file
				3. set an env var to provide creds to your app
					```sh
						export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_file>
					```
				4. authenticate in your code with default creds (find example code for your language)
					1. if you dont specify the credentials, the client library will look for credentials in the environment (step 3)
					2. if the env isnt set, ADC will use a default service account that compute engine, container engine, app engine, and cloud functions provide (if your app runs those services)
					3. if neither 1 or 2 are available, an error is trhown
			- use cases:
		    - control privileges used by resources for applications to perform actions on behalf of authenticated end users
		    - authenticate one service to another
				- can have up to 10 keys associated with them to faciliate key rotation (done daily by google)
				- enable authentication and authorization: you can assign specific IAM roles to a service account
    3. a google group e.g. test@googlegroups.com
	    - named collection of google accounts & service accounts
	    - apply an access policy to a group of users
	    - cannot be used to establish identity
    4. a G suite domain e.g. username@yourdomain.com
	    - a virtual group of all the members in an organization
	    - cannot be used to establish idenity
		5. cloud identity domain
			- a virtual group of all members in an organization
			- does not provide access to g suite applications and features
### IAM Roles: the ACCESS
	- permissions: what operations are allowed on resources,
		- cannot be assigned to users, you must assign permissions to roles, and roles to users
		- usually correspond one-to-one with REST methods
			- the caller of the method needs the associated permissions to call that method
		- syntax: `SERVICE.RESOURCE.VERB`
			- pubsub.subscripts.consume
			- storage.objects.list
  - role: a collection of permissions that can be granted to a user, group, or service account
  - types of roles
    - primitive role: apply across all GCP services in a project using the Cloud Console, API or gcloud CLI
			- viewer: read only actions that preserve state
			- editor: viewer + actions that modify state
				- deploy apps, modify code, configure services\
      - owner: editor permissions + manage project (and its resources) access control + setup billing
				- project: invite, remove, delete,
				- does not contain any permission for the organization resource
      - billing admin: manage billing, add & remove admins
    - predefined roles: IAM fine-grained permissions tailored for specific services
	    - e.g. compute.instanceAdmin, storage.objectAdmin, logging.viewer
    - custom roles: define a role with a specific set of permissions to help implement a principal of least for projects and organizations
      - cant be used for folders
### IAM Resources: the WHAT
	- examples
		- GCP projects
		- compute engine instances
		- cloud storage buckets
		- pub/sub topics
	- resources are organized hierarchically
		- organization
		- projects
		- resources: each has exactly one parent
	- policy: consists of a list of bindings that are attached to a resource and is used to enforce access control whenever that resource is accessed
		- bindings: binds a list of members to a role
		- syntax:
			```js
				{
					"role": "roles/owner", // policy owners
					"members": [
						"user:blah@blah.com",
						"group:admins@blah.com",
						"domain:blah.com",
						"serviceAccount:blah@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
					]
				}
			```
	- API Methods
	  - setIAMPolicy: set policies on resources
	  - getIAMPolicy: get a policy that was previously set
	  - testIamPermissions: test if the caller has the specified permissions for a resource

# Core Products

## Cloud Launcher
  - tool for quickly deploying functional software packages to GCP
    - marketplace containing prepackaged ready to deploy solutions
    - some created by google (free), other by third party vendors (could cost)
    -

## Virtual Private Cloud
  - generally the first step is to define a VPC for a project
  - connects GCP rsources to each other and the internet
  - VPC Peering: interconnect networks in GCP projects
  - shared VPC:  share a network or individual subnets with other GCP projects
  - Characteristics
    - networks are global
    - subnets are regional
      - different zones can be part of the same subnet
      - can dynamically increase the size of a subnet by expanding the ranges of IPs allocated to it
    - routing tables: used to forward traffic from one instance to another within the same network without requiring an external IP address
    - firewall: are globally distributed, you can restrict access to instances both incoming and outging traffic
      - metadata tags on compute engines
### interconnect with networks external to GCP
  - VPN: secure multi-Gbps connection over VPN tunnels
    - use cloud router to make it dynamic
  - direct peering: private connection between you and google for hybrid cloud workloads
  - carrier peering: connection through larget partner network of service providers
  - dediated interconnect: connect N X 10G transpart circuits for private cloud traffic to google cloud at google POPs
    - when you need a service level agreement
    - requires you to use the providers network typology
### cloud load balancing: load balance inbound traffic
  1.  http and https inbound traffic
    - global http(s): layer 7 load balanced based on load
      - route different urls to different back ends
      - put your application behind a single & global anycast IP to the entire internet
      - load balances traffic among all your backend instances
      - integrated with GCP CDN
  2. non http/https inbound traffic
    - global ssl proxy: layer 4 load balancing of no https ssl traffic based on load
      - supported on specific port numbers
    - global tcp proxy: layer 4 load balancing of non ssl tcp traffic
      - supported on specific port numbers
  3. for UDP traffic and TCP(non ssl) traffic
    - regional: load balancing of tcp (non ssl), udp on any port numbers
      - supported on any port number
  4. for internal tiers of multi-tier applications
    - regional internal: load balancing of traffic inside a vpc
      - use for the internal tiers of multi tier applications
    - accepts traffic on a GCP internal IP address and load balances it across compute engine VMs
### Cloud DNS:
  - create managed zones, then add, edit, delete DNS records
  - programmatically manage zones and records using restful APIs or CLI or console
### Cloud CDN:
  - distributed edge caches to cache content close to end users

## compute infrastructure for applications
  - cloud architectures: from managed infrastructure to dynamic infrastructure
    1. IaaS: infrastructure as a service
      - compute engine: general computing workloads
        - deploy your app in virtual machines
    2. Hybrid: incorporates IaaS and PaaS
      - kubernetes engine: container based workloads
        - deployr app in containers
    3. PaaS: platform as a service: google provides the infrastructure for your app so you can focus on your code
      - app engine: focus on code and with less responsibility for managing infrastructure/provisioning
        - flex: use any runtime you want with full control over the environment
          - web and mobile applications
          - container based workloads
        - standard: use one of the supported runtimes with finer grain scaling
          - web and mobile applications
    4. Serverless: no responsibility for managing infrastructure
      - BaaS: Backend as a service
        - database services
        - authentication services
      - FaaS: functions as a service
        - cloud functions: you supply chunks of code for business logic triggered by events
          -
### Compute Engine
  - run a VM
    - OS
    - memory
    - # of virtual CPUs
    - persistant storage
      - standard
      - ssd
      - attach a local SSD that doesnt last when the VM is terminated
  - types of VMs
    - preemptible VM: give compute engine permission to terminate it if its resources are needed elseware
    -
### kubernetes
  - Container Based virtualization is different than hypervisor (regular VM) based virtualization
    - container: app -> lib -> container runtime -> host OS + kernel -> hardware
      - give processes their own namespace
      - each container does not have
      - consistenc yacross dev, testing, prod env
      - loose coupling between app and operating system layers
      - simplified migration between on premis and cloud envs
      -
    - hypervisor: app -> lib -> guest OS -> hypervisor -> hardwar
  - kubernetes: orchestration layer for containers
    - uses the docker container
    - POD: a group of containers that can be deployed together
      - you can perform rolling updates, which incrementally replaces containers in pods with new ones without downtime
    - cluster: a group of machines where kubernetes can schedule containers
      - node: a machine
      -
  - kubernetes engine: managed service, a hybrid IaaS and PaaS (sits in the middle)
    - build manage and delete a  cluster with arbitrary requirements
    - give kubernetes a description of the application config, and kubernetes manages
  - google cloud container builder: create docker container images from app code in google cloud storage
  - google container registry: docker image storage for a specific project
### app engine
  - cost
    - standard environment: pay per instance class after daily free use with automatic shutdown
    - flexible environment: pay for resource allocation per hour, no automatic shutdown
  - manages the hardware and networking infrastructure required to run your app
  - you give app engine your code, and it handles the rest
    - nosql dbs
    - in-memory caching
    - load balancing
    - health checks
    - logging
    - user authentication
    - auto scaling based on traffic

      - runtime: the executable environment to run your application
        - python
        - java
        - php
        - GO
    - sdks
      - multiple SDK kits in various languages
      - simple commands for deployment
    - sandbox
      - your code must run in a sandbox
      - independent of hte hardware, operating system, or phsyical locatino of the server your app is running on
      - constraints
        - app cant write to the local file system
          - must use a db service
        - all requests have a 60 second timeout
        - you cant install arbitrary third party software
    - workflow
      1. dev and test locally
      2. use SDK to deploy to app engine
      3. app engine automatically scales and reliable serves the application
        - app engine can access a variaty of services using dedicated apis
          - nosql datastore
          - caching via memcache
          - searching
          - logging
          - task queues
          - scheduled tasks
          -

      - click web preview in cloud shell port `:8080`
  - YAML: templating language used by many google cloud services
  - disabling deployed applications
    - App Engine offers no option to undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed, although you could instead replace the application with a simple page that says something like "not in service."
      - However, you can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.
      - `home -> app engine -> settings -> disable application`

## API management tools
  - have a well defined interface that abstracts away needless details
  - documented interface
  - the underlying implementation can change as long as the interface doesnt
  - when you have to change an API
    - always version your API
    - consumers should be able to specify the API version they want to use
### cloud endpoints
  - develop, deploy, protect and monitor APIs based ont he open APIs specification or GRPC
  - distributed api management through api console
  - expose the api using a restful interface
  - control access and validate calls with json web tokens and google api keys

	- best practices
		- naming bucket names are public and must be globally unique
			- DO:
				- use globally unique bucket names
				- use GUIDs when a lot of buckets are required
				- conform to standard DNS naming conventions
					- bucket names can appear in a DNS record as part of a CNAME redirect
			- DONT
				- use personally identifiable information (PII)
				- use user IDs, emails, project names/IDs
				- use IP address notation
				- use the google prefix/include any spelling similar to google
					- e.g. goog, gogle, etc
		- cloud storage traffic:
			- consider :
				- operations per second
				- bandwidth
				- cache control
					- if specified in object metadata:
						- read latency will be lowered on hot/frequently accessed objects
			- design to minimize spikes in traffic
			- spread updates through the day
			- always use exponential backoff when retrying failed requests
			- requests
				- > 1000 write requests per second or 500 read requests per second
					- start with a request rate below/near threshold
					- double request rate no faster than every 20 minutes
				- < than the above
					- no ramp up is needed
		- location and availability
			- store data in a region closest to your application users
			- for analytics workloads, store data in regional buckets to reduce network charges and better performance (compared to multi-regional)
			- consider compliance requirements when choosing data location
			- storage optoins
		- bucket security
			- access control
				- IAM: identity and access management permissions
					- access to buckets
					- bulk access to bucket's objects
				- ACLs: access control lists
					- only when you need fine grained control
					- read/write access to users for individual buckets/objects
					- access when fine-grained control over individual objects is required
				- Signed URLs: query string authentication
					- provide time-limited read/write access to an object through a generated URL
					- can be created using gsutil/programmatically
				- Signed Policy Documents
					- specify what can be uploaded toa  bucket
					- control size, content type, and other upload characteristics
					- only work with forum posts
					- for website owners to allow visitors to uplaod files to cloud storage
				- Firebase security rules
					- granular, attribute-based access control to mobile & weeb apps using firebase SDKs for cloud storage
			- use TLS (HTTPS) to transport data
			- use an https library that validates server certificates
			- revoke authnetication credentials to applications that no longer need access to data
			- securely store credentials
			- use groups isntead of large numbers of users
			- bucket and object ACLs are independent of each other
				- make sure default bucket permissions are valid before uploading objects
				- a user denied to a bucket can still access objects inside the bucket if they have permissions
			- avoid making buckets publicly readable / writable
		- XMLHttpRequests
			- when using XHR callbacks for progress updates
				- do not close/reopen connection
				- it creaes a bad positive feedback loop during times of congestion
					- when the network congested, XHR callbacks get backlog behind the acnowledgement activity from the upload stream
		- upload traffic
			- make the request to create the resumable upload URL from the same region as the bucket and upload location
				- colocate compute engine instances and cloud storage buckets
				- use a geo-ip service to pick the compute engine region to which you route customer request
					- helps keep traffic localized to a geo region
			- set reasonable long timeouts for upload traffic
			- avoid breaking tansfers into smaller chunks
			- avoid uploading content that has both:
				- content-encoding gzip
				- content-type that is compressed
		- gsutil for cloud storage
			- gsutil -D will include oauth2 refresh and access tokens in the output
				- make sure to redact this information
			- gsutil --trace-token will include oauth2 tokens and the contents of any files accessed during the trace
			- .boto config file
				- customer-supplied encryption key information
				- proxy configuration information
					- host and port number for proxy
					- may include user/pass info
			- in a product environment, use a service account for gsutil
				- never use user creds
		- validate your data
			- corruption during upload/download
				- noisy network links
				- memory errors
					- client computer
					- server computers
					- routers along the path
				- software bugs
			- validate data during transport
				- CRC32c Hash
					- available for all cloud storage objects
					- gsutil automatically performs integrity checks on all uploads and downloads
				- MD5 Hash
					- supported for non-composite objects
					- cannot be used for partial downloads caused by performing a range get
				- specify a specific bucket for scripts hosted in cloud storage accessing static resources in websites external to cloud storage
	- Use cases
		- use storage classes for object life cycle management
			- store and archive data based on frequency of access
	  - storing/retrieving large # of files, or multi-terabyte file exports and data dumps for data analytics pipelines
		  - images, videos,
			- objects and blobs,
			- any unstructured data,
			- static website hosting (html css js),
				- automatically authenticates users
				- supports cross-origin resource sharing
				- no need for compute engine VMs
				- automatic scaling
			- backups
	    - includes end-user uploaded content
	  - for structured/unstructured binary and immutable large object storage
	    - each object is given a URL
	    - objects are organized in buckets, in geographic locations
	  - immutable blobs larger than 10 megabytes e.g. images/movies
	  - combine up to 32 objects into a new single object without transferring additional object data
		  - great for recovering for network failures during uploads
	  - parallel uploads: divide an object into multiple pieces
		  - great for speeding up uploads
		  - upload the pieces to a temporary location simultaneously
			- compose the original object from these temp pieces
			- delete the temporary pieces
		- object composition: uploading an object in parallel
			- dividing your data and uploading each chunk into a distinct object
				- compose your final object
				- deleting temporary objects

### Cloud Datastore
	- for structured/semi-structured data
  - fully managed NoSQL horizontally scalable document store
	  - built on top of BigTable
  - designed to automatically scale to very large datasets, sharding, and replication
    - terabytes of capacity
    - maximum unit size of one megabyte per entity
    - offers transactions that affet multiple db rows
    - can scale from 0 to millions of requests per second without any user management
	    - write scale: automatically distributing data
	    - read scale: only supports queries whose performance scales with the size of the result set
			  - does not support
				  - join operations
				  - inequality filtering on multiple properties
				  - filtering on data based on results of subqueries
	- concepts
		- difference with relational DBs
			- object: KIND vs TABLE
			- one object: ENTITY vs ROW
			- object datum: PROPERTY vs FIELD
			- object unique ID: KEY vs PRIMARY KEY
		- files
			- *index.yaml*: the config file for datastore
		- indexes
			- only for properties needed for a query
				- uneccesary indexes result in increased latency and storage costs
			- do not index properties with monotonicallyincreasing values, e.g. date/timestamps
			- types
				- built-in:
					- automaticlly pre-define an index for each property of an entity kind
					- are suitable for simple types of queries
				- composite indexes:
					- index multiple property values for indexed entity
					- support for complex queries
					- defined in an index configuration file
					- are viewable not editable in the web console
		- entities: data objects
			- properties: entities are made up of properties
			- key: uniquely identifies an entity
				- for numeric keys:
					- dont use a negative number
					- do not use 0
					- sequential numeric IDs creates bigtable hot spots
						- impacts cloud datastore latency
						- get a block of IDs using the allocateIds() method to assign your own numeric IDs
							- generates well distributed sequences of numeric IDs
					- avoid monotonically increasing values, especiialy for apps with large traffic
						- this creates a bigtable hotspot
							- writes to new entities are always occuring at the end of the row key space
								- prevents bigtable from effectively distributing writes
			- namespace:
			- kind: the entity type, e.g. Customer
			- identifier: string/numeric id
			- ancestor ID: optional
				- root entity: an entity without an ancestor (parent)
				- ancestor path: the sequence of entities from a root entity to child entity forms the ancestor path
					- entity groups: the group of entities connected by the ancestor path
						- queries of entity groups give you a consistent view of your data
						- all related entities can be updated in a single transaction
			- transactions: operations on one/more entities
				- are atomic
	- best practices
		- use UTF-8 characters for
			- namespace names
			- kind names
			- property names
			- key names
		- avoid forward slash */*
			- in kind names
			- in custom key names
		- avoid storing sensitive information in a cloud project ID
		- read/writes/deletes
			- traffic: ramp up gradually with the 555 rule
				- 500 writes per second and increase by 50% every 5 minutes
				- distribute writes across a key range
			- batch operations: use for read, writes and deletes
				- allow you to perform multiple operations with the same overhead as a single operation
			- transactions: set of datastore operations on one/more entities
				- should always be idempotent:
					- if you repeat a transaction, the end result will be the same
					- no side effects if it is called more than once with the same input parameters
				- are atomic: either all are applied or none are applied
				- max time of 60 seconds
					- but transactions over 30 seconds will be terminated if idle for 10 seconds/more
				- rollback failed transactions to minimize retry latency for concurrent requests for the same resource in a transaction
					- dont retry rollbacks that throw an exception
				- can fail when
					- too many concurrent modifications attempted on the same entity group
					- exceed resource limits
					- datastore has internal error
					- datastore operations in a transaction operate on more than 25 entity groups
			- requests
				- always use asynchronous calls to minimize latency impact
			- queries
				- types:
					- keys only:
						- `select key from task`
						- retrieve only the key
						- return results at lower latency and cost
					- projection:
						- `select one, two from task`
						- retrieve specific properties from an entity
						- retrieve only the properties included in the query filter
						- return results at lower latency and cost
					- ancestor:
						- `select one, two from task where has ancestor key(tasklist, 'defualt')`
						- return strongly consistent results
						- requires your data to be structured for strong consistency
					- entity:
						- `select * from task where done = true`
						- retrieve an entity kind, zero or more filters, and zero or more sort orders
				- latency: use cursors > offsets
					- integer offsets:
						- doesnt return skipped entities to your app but it still retrieves the entities internally
							- cause your app to be billed for read operations
					- query cursors:
						- retrieve a query's results in convenient batches
						- don't incur the overhead of a  query offset
			- maximum transaction throughput is limited to 1 write per second per entity group
				- split frequently updated entities across multiple kinds
				- if you update an entity group too rapidly
					- higher latency
					- timeouts
					- and other contention errors
			- avoid high read/writes to keys that are lexicographically close
			- gradually ramp up traffic to new cloud datastore kinds/portions of the keyspace
				- gives bigtable sufficient time to shard (split) tables as the traffic grows
			- avoid deleting large numbers of cloud datastore entities across a small range of keys
				- compaction: rewriting tables to remove deleted entries and reorganizing data so that reads & writes are more efficient
			- for hot cloud datastore keys
				- use sharding to write to a portion of the key range at a higher rate
					- sharding: splits a single entity into many,
						- e.g. Customer KIND may have 100 entities, the first 50 stored in one key range, the next 50 stored in another
						- you can shard manually if the number of your application writes exceeds the bigtable limits
						- shard counters to avoid contention with high writes
							- build a sharded counter: break the counter up into N different counters
								- pick a shard at random to increment the counter
								- increasing the number of shards will increase the throughput you will have for increments on your counter
				- use replication to read a portion of the key range at a higher rate than big table permits
					- store N copies of the same entity, allowing an N times higher rate of reads
						- e.g. a static config file that gets loaded per request, when loading your app will pick a random number between 0 and N and
		- handling errors
			- 4xx or 5xx response codes
			- do not retry without fixing the problem
				- ALREADY_EXISTS
				- FAILED_PRECONDITION
				- INVALID_ARGUMENT
				- NOT_FOUND
				- PERMISSION_DENIED
				- RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
				- UNAUTHENTICATED
			- retry using exponential backoff
				- DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
				- UNAVAILABLE
			- do not retry this request more than once
				- INTERNAL
			- for a non transactional commit: retry the request/structure your enitties to reduce contention
				- ABORTED
			- for requests that are part of a transactional commit: retry th eentire transaction/structure your entities to reduce contention
				- ABORTED
  - use cases
    - for durable key-value data
    - best choice for high value application data
      - user profiles, shopping carts, orders, etc.
    - store structured / semi-structured or hierarchical data
    - managing multiple indexes over each entity
    - support for crossroad transactions
    - integration point for app engine and compute engine with cloud

      - save money on the cost of the cluster by configuring the build process to use preemptible compute engine instances for your batch processing
        - requires that your jobs can be restarted cleanly if they're terminated
        - around 80% cheaper
  - managed services
    - apache hadoop: open source framework for big data based on the mapreduce programming model

    - spark & spark sql:
      - do data mining
      - MLliB: machine learning libraries to run classification algorithms to discover patterns through machine learning
    - pig,
    - hive
  - other use cases (extension of use cases for the managed services above)

        - automatic discount for long-term data storage automatically
        - sharing does NOT impact your cost or performance
          - but those users will be charged for running queries
      - queries: incur charges based on the amount of data they process:
        - when you submit a query, you pay for the compute nodes only for the duration of that query.
        - don't have to pay to keep a compute cluster up and running.
  - terms
    - Datasets: a grouping mechanism that holds zero or more tables.

### cloud pub/sub
  - scalable and flexible enterprise messaging architecture for events in realtime and stream analytics
    - on demand scalability beyond one million messages per second
	  - application components make push/pull subscriptions to topics
	  - provides at least once delivery
	    - theres a small chance some messages might be delivered more than once
  - concepts
	  - publisher: application that publishes messages to a topic
	  - subscriber: creates a subscription to a topic
		  - execution environments
			  - cloud functions: triggered whenever a new message is received
				  - serverless approach
			  - deploy a subscriber application on computer/container/ appengine flexible environment
				  - multiple instances can spinup and process the messages in the topic and split the workload
				  - instances can be auto shutdown when there are few messages
					  - autoscale using stackdriver metrics
	  - subscription: a subscriber push/pull messages from a topic
		  - pull: subscribers calls pull method to request messages and receives a message and acknowledgement ID
			  - default subscription
				  - enables batch delivery and acknowledgements and parallel consumption
			  - subscribers
					- control rate of delivery and acknowledgement deadline
					- multiple subscribers can pull from the same subscription
				  - can be any app using gcloud client libraries
				- message delivery: messages are delivered to each subscription at least once
					- subscriber sends acknowledgement of receipt to the pub/sub service
					- if subscriber doesnt acknowledge receipt of message before the acknowledgement deadline, it will receive the message again
		  - push: subscribers dont need to implement gcloud client libraries to retrieve and process messages
			  - message delivery
				  - pubsub service sends each message as an http request to the subscriber at a preconfigured http endpoint
					  - e.g. a load balancer / appengine standard app
					  - the http endpoint acknowledges receipt by reutrning an http success status code
						  - failure response indicates the message should be sent again
						  - pubsub dynamically adjusts the rate of pushes based on the rate it receives success responses
  - use cases
	  - message ordering is NOT guaranteed
	  - pull subscription
		  - process large volumes of messages with high throughput
	  - push subscription
		  - whenever gcloud credentials/client libraries cant be configured
		  - multiple topics must be processed by the same webhook
		  - when an http endpoint will be envoked by pubsub and other apps
			  - the subscriber should be able to process message payloads for each consumer of the endpoint
	  - use topics as a buffer for incoming data
		  - data generating services acts as publishers
		  - downstream services acts as a subscriber and consume the data at a reasonable pace
	  - real time gaming apps, click stream data injection/processing, device/sensor data procesing for healthcare/manufacturing, integrating data sources in financial apps
	  - supports offline consumers
	  - loosely coupled microservices

# basics
  - GCP: google cloud Platform
  - GCP Resources:
    - physical assets: computers, hard disk drives
    - virtual resources: VMs
    - Google data centers:
      - located in a global region: Central US, w. Europe, E. Asia
      - each reach has multiple zones  which are isolated from each other
        - asia-east1-a
    - global resources:  can be accessed by any other resource, across regions and zones. These global resources include
      - preconfigured disk images,
      - disk snapshots, and
      - networks
    - regional resources: static external IP addresses.
      - , you wouldn't want to attach a disk in one region to a computer in a different region because the latency you'd introduce would make for very poor performance. Thankfully, GCP won't let you do that; disks can only be attached to computers in the same zone.
    - zonal resources: VM instances, their types and disks
  - GCP Projects: Any GCP resources that you allocate and use must belong to a project. You can think of a project as the organizing entity for what you're building
    - project is made up of the settings, permissions, and other metadata that describe your applications
      - A project name, which you provide.
      - A project ID, which you can provide or GCP can provide for you.
      - A project number, which GCP provides.
    - The resources that each project contains remain separate across project boundaries; you can only interconnect them through an external network connection.
  - Services
    -
# services
  - GCP gives you three basic ways to interact with the services and resources.
      - GUI
    - GCP console
    - CLI
      - Google cloud SDK provides gcloud cl tool
      - cloud shell: browser-based interactive shell environment
    - client libraries
      -
## Compute: virtual machines
  - Compute Engine: Virtual Machines
  - App Engine: PaaS for apps and backends
  - Kubernetes engine: containers
  - cloud functions: event driven serverless compute platform
  - Containers & Container Management
  - Functions and Lambdas (serverless)
  -
## storage: files and databases
  - Storing
    - cloud storage for firebase hot files: frequently accessed
    - cloud filestore: cold files: archival
    - Persistent Disk: block storage for VMs: (also a type of hot file)
  - Data Services
    - NoSQL: highly available and eventually consistent
      - cloud bigtable: wide-column db service
      - cloud datastore: nosql document db service
    - RDBMS:
      - Cloud SQL: mysql + postgres
      - cloud spanner:
    - Hadoop & Spark
## Big Data
  - data pipelines: ability to string together different data services as you process data across different workloads
  - data warehouses: very large data storage for read only / infrequently updated enterprise reporting
  - data science notebooks:
    - jupiter notebooks, interactive webpages that allow computation & analysis & visualizations, pairs very well with ML
## other services: networking, ML, etc.
