code coverage: tool that determines how much of your code is covered by unit tests. it also shows you what is and isnt being covered

'type' of tests
  units tests: Unit Tests are functions and classes designed to prove the code performs withing a set of guidelines

  functional tests: multiple unit tests working together in order to test a specific functionality

  acceptance tests: In essence, an acceptance test is an automated version of a user performing some task in your application.  Acceptance tests are the tests of highest level. Generally this kind of tests give us knowledge about how application works from user point of view. For example it allows to see what happened
    * after incorrect fill of the login form,
    * where user will be redirected after correct fill the login form.

  integration tests: tests to check the correct functioning of our system. These tests require an integration environment, instead of using double test as they do the unit tests, and take longer to execute.

  domain tests: testing business logic

  UI Tests: the task of performing tests on the user 'interface'

  blackbox tests: focses on the object state

  white box tests: focuses on the objects behavior
    -mocking: allows you test behavior

  smoke test: testing the environment

  monitoring tests: testing continuously at regular intervals

  regression tests: testing old functionality, to ensure new changes are not breaking existing functionality

-objects: entities that send messages to each other
  public messages: represented as public functions that others can call
  private messages: represent private functions that only the object can call on itself
  --all public and private methods accessible through public methods represent the behavior of an object

test components

  -dummy objects: objects that the System Under Test (SUT) depends on, but are never actually used.
    e.g.
      .argument passed to another object
      .object returned from one object to be sent to another object
    .any object that is required to run/test some behavior, but is not actually used (e.g. a required parameter) and must resemble a real object
  -test stubs: an object to control the indirect input of the tested code. setting up state
    .Test stubs are functions (spies) with pre-programmed behavior. They support the full test spy API in addition to methods which can be used to alter the stub’s behavior.
    .Control a method’s behavior from a test to force the code down a specific path. Examples include forcing a method to throw an error in order to test error handling.
    .When you want to prevent a specific method from being called directly (possibly because it triggers undesired behavior, such as a XMLHttpRequest or similar).
  -test spies:
    .A test spy is a function that records arguments, return value, the value of this and exception thrown (if any) 'for' all its calls. A test spy can be an anonymous function or it can wrap an existing function.
    .a test spy can also spy on existing functions. When doing so, the original function will behave just as normal (including when used as a constructor) but you will have access to data about all calls.
  -test mocks: style of testing different levels of faking the behavior of an object
  -test fakes

  - test spies

definitions:
  Specifications: what the program is suppose to do
    component specfifications: communicate the visual design
      executable specifications (test component specifications)
    value specifications: communicate what value the project provides
      1. capabilities
      2. feature sets: (groups of features)
      3. specific features
      4. scenarios

      executable specifications (test value specifications);
    visual design
    solution design: what you will use to solve the problem
    domain model

  tests: the specifications executed against actual code

testing triangle:
  3. End to end tests (tens)
  2. service tests (hundreds)
  1. unit tests (thousands)

NOTES ON STRUCTURE
  the features are not mapped to unit tests
  the features aid in the creation of unit tests
  @watch to IT block statements and as scenario decorators

  test block (e.g. it)
    1. clear state: clear environment from previous state
    2. setup: setup environment
    3. execute: run some code saved result to var
    4. verify: assert #3 ===|!== expected results

  scenarios| value specification
    given
    when
    then

  jira tickets

    so that ....

  unknown when to use
    arrange > act > assert
WORKFLOW
  use value specs to create the domain
    given
    when
    then
  start with domain (but do for each of domain forks) and create:
    create feature file with scenarios
      feature:
        IN ORDER TO
        AS
        I WANT

        scenario 1
          given
          when
          then
        scenario 2:
          etc.
    create step definitions
      given
      when
      then
    model your domain and create a domain model with factories, classes, services, and specs

  create classes & spec files (i.e. components and there tests)


cucumber: Cucumber is a tool 'for' running automated tests written in plain language.
  features: tests/specifications/blah.feature
    in order to do something I want
    as a person
    I want to get a bunch of money
    secenario: find a burrito
      given: i have 5 bucks
      when: when I walk in the store
      then: I buy a burrito

    concepts are created via design
    value specifications: capture busines domain
    domain model: describes state
      entities
      relationships
      state
    visual design: designer
    solution design:
    component specifications

  support: tests/support/world.js
    -Support files let you setup the environment in which steps will be run, and define step definitions.
      // features/support/world.js
      var zombie = require('zombie');
      function World() {
        this.browser = new zombie(); // this.browser will be available in step definitions

        this.visit = function (url, callback) {
          this.browser.visit(url, callback);
        };
      }

      module.exports = function() {
        this.World = World;
      };

  step.definitions
    -the glue between features written in Gherkin and the actual system under test. They are written in JavaScript.
    -All step definitions will run with this set to what is known as the World in Cucumber.
    -A new instance of World is created before each scenario.
    -this is an object holding important properties like the Given(), When() and Then() functions.
    -Another notable property is World; it contains a default World constructor that can be either extended or replaced.

    // features/step_definitions/my_step_definitions.js
    module.exports = function () {
      this.Given(/^I am on the Cucumber.js GitHub repository$/, function (callback) {
        // Express the regexp above with the code you wish you had.
        // `this` is set to a World instance.
        // i.e. you may use this.browser to execute the step:

        this.visit('https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js', callback);

        // The callback is passed to visit() so that when the job's finished, the next step can
        // be executed by Cucumber.
      });

      this.When(/^I go to the README file$/, function (callback) {
        // Express the regexp above with the code you wish you had. Call callback() at the end
        // of the step, or callback(null, 'pending') if the step is not yet implemented:

        callback(null, 'pending');
      });

      this.Then(/^I should see "(.*)" as the page title$/, function (title, callback) {
        // matching groups are passed as parameters to the step definition

        var pageTitle = this.browser.text('title');
        if (title === pageTitle) {
          callback();
        } else {
          callback(new Error("Expected to be on page with title " + title));
        }
      });
    };

always pass around objects, next strings

          scenarios
            steps


modules

  proxy require:
    whenever you see X being imported, replace it with a different require



  fixtures: data you put into a db (e.g.) for testing purposes

  factories: logic to construct aggregates (i.e. objects). a function
  builder: logic to construct a factory with data


  imports:
    domain: all the domain logic goes in here
      hexagonal architecture: 6 sided block
        domain core: core logic
        domain core forks: different aspects of the domain, e.g. Rest API, UI, persistence infrastructure layer, testing, etc.
    infrastructure: stores stuff to the db
    UI: all the components stuff:
    application:  e.g. controller

    google event stores

  src:
  tests
    specifications: each feature requires a .feature file

    meteor
      SRC = root of application
        all immediate children are loaded global scope
        server -> goes to server
        client -> clinet
        imports -> must be required (like npm modules)

  mocking:
    -test doubles: automatically generate nn object that implements Implements all the behavior of an interface/class.
      https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/test-doubles.html
      .all methods return null without calling the original method
      $this->createMock($type) //$type e.g. 'someClassName'
        .immediately returns  a test double object 'for' the specified type
        .__construct() and __clone() of original $type are not executed
        .arguments passed to a method will not be cloned

      $this->getMockBuilder($type) //$type e.g. 'someInterfaceName'
        .use when you need to customize the test double generation
