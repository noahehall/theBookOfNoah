	- network events
	- load event
	- better use of teh error event 
	- use cases for text composition events
	- usecases for value change events
	- fuck lets do webvr bitch
	- your idb installation is prehistoric, use check the database events
	- usecases for scriptevents
	- tabevents might be useful for sw
	- sensor events for mobile web
	- DOM mutation events

## almost best practices 
	- use the event handler properties when available, because fuck it
	- always validate headers (but beware non browsers can fake this shit)
		- send a 400 if any header not up to par and immediately close the connection
		- 

### use cases 
	- pushing shit 
		- http2 push (browser level, doesnt reach application code)
		- server sent events ( half-duplex, clients connects -> server push)
		- web sockets (full-duplex, client conects -> server|client push)
			- may have issues with multiple tabs, as the browser is limited to 6 websocket connections
			- thus if your app is number 7, fuuuuuuk
		- long polling, ajax, whatever the fk (go work for facebook with that bs)
		- server worker Push API (unidirectional, routes msgs through browser vender)

## responses 
	- informational 100-199
	- successful 200-299
		- 200 'OK' generall success
		- 201 'Created'
		- 202 'Accepted'
			- used for batch processing, etc, to let the client know something may happen in the future, but dont wait on it
		- 203 - fuck 203
		- 204 'No Content'
			- when the client should review the headers for additional info
		- 205 'Reset Content'
			- client should reset the doc which sent the request
		- 206 'Partial Content'
			- when the `Range` header is sent from the client to request only part of a resource
	- redirects 300-399
	- client errors 400-499
		- 400 'Bad Request'
			- the client fucked up
		- 401 'Unauthorized'
			- the client must authenticate to get the requested response 
		- 403 'Forbidden'
			- the server knows the client, but refuses to be friends, fucking racist
		- 404 'Not Found'
			- call the police
		- 405 'Method Not Allowed'
		- 408 'Request Timeout'
		- 418 'Ima Teapot'
			- the server refuses the attempt to brew coffee with a teapot
		- 426 'Upgrade Required'
		- 428 'Precondition Required'
		- 429 'Too many hos calling my phone'
		- 451 'Unavailable cuz police tapping my phone'
	- server errors 500-599
		- ive done nothing wrong bitch


## headers 
	- Origin 
		- ensure same origin, whitelist/blacklist
	- Sec-WebSocket-Version 
		- the websocket protocol version(s) the server understands

	- guidelines 
		- each header line must end in `\r\n`
		- the last header must end in `\r\n\r\n` to indicate its the last header

## terminology 
	- TCP
		- transport layer host-to-host protocol for connection-oriented communication between two computers on an IP network 
		- uses virtual ports to create a virtual end-to-end connection that can reuse the physical connections between two computers
		- encapsulates higher level protocol data such as http and smtp (email)
	- websocket handshake 
		- i.e. the 'web' in websocket (wtf does that even mean MDN?)
		- nvm its the bridge from http to WebSockets (think https to http)
		- details of the connection are negotiated, and either party can backout before completion if the terms are unfavorable
	- control frame 
		- todo 
	- websocket extensions (header)
		- control the websocket frame and modif the payload
		- optional and generalized (like cheese on a burger)
	- websocket subprotocols (header)
		- structure the websocket protocol and NEVER modify anything
			- e.g. the json weboscket-protocol informs all parties to relay day as json
		- mandatory and localized (i.e. specific to a usecase, e.g. chat|games)
		- implemented on the server and cannot be externally refered to by th client
	- close event code 
		- sent to clients/servers using websockets when the connection is closed 
		- 0-999 not used 
		- 1000 normal closure 
		- 1001 going away (e.g. due to navigation)
		- 1002 protocol error
		- 1003 unsupported data (e.g. sending data in the wrong format)
		- 1005 no status received (e.g. you forgot to specify a code when closing the connection)
		- 1006 abnormal closure (e.g. the connection was closed properly)
		- 1007 invalid frame payload data (e.g. something was wrong with the data being sent)
		- 1008 policy violation (e.g. watching porn at work)
		- 1009 message too big (e.g. msg too big in data frame)
		- 1010 missing extension (client expected server to negotiate extension, but server didnt)
		- 1011 internal error (wtf im never at fault)
		- 1012 service restart (e.g. hotreload baby)
		- 1013 try again later (e.g. overloaded|too many clients|hos)
		- 1014 bad gateway (e.g. similar to 502 http status code, server (gateway) has issue with upstream)
		- 4000-4999 (for use by applications)
		- 



	
## use cases 
	- enable two way interactive communication session between the users browser and a server 
	- send messages to servers and receive event driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply


## best practices 
	- use a reverse proxy to detect websocket handshakes, pre-process them,  and then route the clients to a real websocket server 
		- helps to keep the cookie/authentication logic separate from the websocket server
	- request uris (e.g. poop.com/flush) has no defined meaning in the spec 
		- you can use it to let one websocket server handle mutiple websocket applications 
		- like a websocket reverse proxy
	- keeping track of clients 
		- after establishing a websocket connection with a client, track them!
		- you dont want to go through the handshake process multiple times with the same client 
		- the same client IP address can attempt connections multiple times
			- be careful of DoS attacks if they try too many
		- e.g. usernames/ids + websocket + other data needed to identify each connection
	

## gotchas 
	- the websocket server may listen on any port
		- however, ports other than 80|443 may have problems with firewalls|proxies 
	- browsers generally require a secure connnection for websockets
	- websockets require >= HTTP 1.1
	- socketio is NOT a websocket implementation 
		- socketio uses WebSocket as a transport when possible 
		- however, a websocket client CANNOT connect to a socketio server
		- and a sockeetio server CANNOT connection a websocket client


## lifecycle 
	- the websocket server listens for incoming socket connections on a standard TCP socket
	- websockt handshake
		- client applications MUST send a GET request to begin a websocket connection to the websocket request-uri to initiate the websocket handshake
			- the websocket details are sent as headers in the GET request
		- the websocket server optionally responds with various headers/requests for authentication|redirects to validate the websocket connection request
		- finally the websocket server responds to the handshake with headers indicating the websocket protocol version to use 
	- websocket success 
		- bi-directional communication is now possible 
		- communication occurs via exchanging data frames 
			- wtf
			- think its an http2 thing, but dunno
			- use a library
		- decoding the payload length 
			- use a fucking library
		- reading and unmasking the data 
			- take a break, then use a library
		- messaage fragmentation 
			- take another break, the continue with the library
	- keeping connection alive
		- either side of the connection can ping the other as a health check
		- the pong must be sent asap and include the exact same payload data received in the ping
			- max payload length === 125
			- if you get more than one ping, before responding, still only send response back
	- closing the connection 
		- either side of the websocket connection can request to close the connection 
		- upon receipt of such request, respond with a Close frame response 
		- the requester will then close the connection 
		- any data received after the connection is closed should be discarded



	- server side examples
```js 
	// websocket handshake: standard headers to request a websocket connection 
		// have to send the Sec-Websocket-Key for the server to send back the Sec-WebSocket-Accept
		// the client asks the server if it supports a subprotocol(s) the client understands
		
		`
			GET /chat HTTP/1.1
			Host: example.com:8000
			Upgrade: websocket
			Connection: Upgrade
			Sec-WebSocket-Key: s0m3fck1nGk3y
			Sec-WebSocket-Version: 187
			Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: json, soap, wamp
		`
	// websocket handhskae: server response indicating the websocket protcol version
		// Sec-Websocket-Accept header is derived from the Sec-Websocket-Key in the client request
		// the server should pick the first websocket-protocol in the reuquest header it supports or dont send the header back at ALL (never send blank)
		`
			HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
			Upgrade: websocket

# DOM
	- [message event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent)

## poop
  - When the browser loads the page, it transforms your HTML into a live document
    1. parses html (strings of text) into a data model (objects and nodes)
    2. preserves the HTML hierarchy by creating a tree of nodes (the DOM)


# history 
	- [history api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
	- [history tutorial](http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html)

## basics
	- enables you to use scripts to modify the URL (and related context) without triggering a page refresh
		- i.e. manipulation of the browser session history
		- i.e. pages visited in the tab/frame that the current page is loaded in

```js
	// navigation
		history.back()
			// previous page in sessino history 
		history.forward()
			// next page in session history
		history.go(-1)
			// @see history.back()
		history.go(1)
			// @see history.forward()
	// manipulation 
		// neither causes browser refreshes or ajax requests
		// eveyrthing you want to happen on state changes 
		// must be handled programmaticaly
		history.state
			// whenever the user navigates to a new state
			// a `popstate` event is fired and contains the state object 
			// see `pushState` and `replaceState`
			// if the browser restarts it MAY contain the state object 
			// associated with the last `pushState` or `replaceState()` methods 

		history.pushState({state}, 'title', 'url')
			// pushes the give data ont he session history stack
			// changes the referrer thats gets used in the HTTP header for ajax requests
			// the referrer will be the url of hte doc whose window is `this` at the time when the ajax object is created
			// calling history.back() after calling history.pushState() does not fire a `popstate` event
			// never fires a `hashchage` event 
		history.replaceState({state}, 'title', 'url')
			// exactly the same as `pushState` except replaces the current history entry 
			// useful when you want to update the stateObject/url of the current 
			// history entry in response to user action

	// events 
		window.onpopstate
			// fired everytime the active history entry changes 
			// contains the state object associated with `replaceState()` and `pushState()` history methods 

```

## terminology 
	- Events 
		- a design pattern used for the async handling of incidents which occur in the lifecycle of something
		- the naming, characterization, and the use of 'events|incidenses' of differnet types 
			- how the fuck do you spell incidencnes
	- triggering DOM events 
		- user action, 
		- automated browser processes (e.g. in the lifecycle of some arbitrary API)
		- programmatically (e.g. someEle.click())
		- manually (e.g. eventTarget.dispatchEvent())
	- handling events 
		- always use eventTarget.addEventListener, fuck IE 
	- dishandling events 
		- couldnt think of a more romantic term 
		- always use eventTarget.removeEventListener 
		- the event name, function (instance), and useCapture flag has to match 
		- there may be mutliple event listeners, and all listeners with the matching 3 items will be removed
	- event phases 
		- target phase
			- listeners attached to the event target
			- will receive events before they are bubbled or able to be captured 
			- the emitted events will trigger all listeners on the element in the order the listeners were registered
		- capture and bubble 
			- order of operations when two/more handlers are listening for the same event on a target that has parents
				1. capture phase
					- browser checks to see if any parents (starting from html on down to event.target) has a handler with capture/useCapture set true
					- if one is found, runs it and continues until it reaches the event.target to start the bubbling the shampane
				2. bubble phase
					- browser checks if event.target has handler with !bubble 
					- if one is found, runs it and continues until it reaches the root html element
				3. if there arent 2/more handlers, it (practically) doesnt matter if you captre or bubble the event, as only the singel handler will be invoked 
					- unless you like to micro optimise, and think the 1ms saving by the capture phase is worht your dumb ass time
	
	- create-init-dispatch process 
		- used for dispatch events into the implementations event model 


## event design pattern 
	- events and event handling pattern to react to incidents that occur
	- web page rendering architecture: 
		- parse -> process -> draw -> present -> loop continuously on incident occurrence
		- emits a page to be partially rendered even when the browser has not finished retrieving all resources
	- pattern contract
		- the name of the event 
		- the datastructure and key properties for a specific event type 
			- all browsers extend  from `EventPrototype`
		- the javascript object which will 'emit' the event
	- pattern implementation 
		- define a function (i.e. listener) which understands the pattern contract 
		- register the function (i.e. listener|handler) on the javascript object which will emit the event via `addEventListener` function
			- e.g. a dom element, document, window, or ANY object that implements the `EventListener` interface
	- event delegation 
		- set the event listener on a parent element with !!bubble
			- be sure `stopPropagation|stopImmediatePropagation()` once handled
		- dispatch the event from any child elements 
	- pattern best practices 
		- dont register event handlers until the `document` emits `DOMContentLoaded`
		- use event delegation where possible
			- when multiple child elements invoke the same event handler
		- use capturing handlers where appropriate 
			- when a child element will invoke an event in an unknown/dynamic location in the dom but the handler is more effective on a parent element
			- 

## observers
	- [intersection observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
	- [mutation observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
		- you have this hsit somewhere
		- but redo anyway when needed
	- [request idleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback)
		- fuck safari
	- [timing element visibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API/Timing_element_visibility)
		- really good example
	- [interection observer entry props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry)


### use cases 
	- intersection observer
		- asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element/viewport
		- lazy loading images/content as a page is scrolled
		- infinite scrolling 
		- reporting of visibility of advertisemnes in order to calculate ad revenues
		- delaying tasks/animation until the result would be visible

### life cycle 
	-intersectino observer
		- register a callback thats invoked whenever a target elmeent intersects with a root element (viewport/domElement)
			- i.e. whenever elX is scrolled across Y% (intersection ratio) of elZ
			- ie. elX is scrolled Y% relative to elZ


```js
	// event shit
		// attach events after this shit
		// the html has been parsed and JS objectes created for all dom nodes
			document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => registerAllMyEventsBitch())

		// listen for events 
			// you can either pass the options object, or the useCapture boolean
			// but NOT both bitch
			eventTarget.addEventListener(
				'eventName',
				listenerFunction,
				{
					// route events to this listener before sending to child elements
					capture: bool,
					// listener should be invoked at most ONCE, then removed
					once: bool,
					// indicates a passive listener, i.e. will never call preventDefault
					// has performance improvemetns if true
					passive: bool,
					mozSystemGroup: 'who the fuck codes for just one browser?'
				},
				// or specify just the capture property, as a boolean
				// specify EITHER the options object above or the boolean below
				// also events that are bubbling upward will not trigger this listener
				// defaults to false
				useCaptureBoolean
			)
		// stop listening for events 
			eventTarget.removeEventListener(
				'eventName',
				listenerFunction,
				useCaptureBoolean, // has to match value provided in addEventListener useCapture/capture
			)


		// create an event (doesnt work in ie, fuck ie)
			// can be used to trigger native events?
			// some of the properties are for event handlers
			// e.g. wtf are you doing trying to set defaultPrevented on instantiation?
			// its just easier to put all this shit here cuz wtf
			const event = new Event(
				'wtf',
				{	
					// does this event bubble to the root html?
					bubbles: bool,
					// does this event resppond to preventDefault()
					cancelable: bool,
					// whether the event wil; propagate across the shadow dom boundary into the standard dom
					// all UA-disaptched events are composed, (e.g. click, touch, etc)
					// only occurs !!bubbles
					composed: bool,

				}
			);

## terminology
	- web workers
		- run scripts in background threads
		- send/receive messages to the calling code
	
	- worker thread
		- perform
		  - tasks without interfering with the UI
		  - I/O using XMLHttpRequest
		  -
	- service workers
		- act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network
		- an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path
		-  a JavaScript file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion
		-  only support HTTPS
		-  firefox: cant be used in private browsing mode
		- Multiple browsing contexts (e.g. pages, clients, etc.) can be associated with the same ServiceWorker object.
		- the ServiceWorker state is not persisted across the termination/restart cycle, 
			- so each event handler should assume it's being invoked with a bare, default global state.
		- Once successfully registered, a service worker can and will be terminated when idle to conserve memory and processor power
	
	-  worker context
		-  a service workers execution environment (e.g. browser, node, worker are all distinct contexts)
		- fully async
		  - cant be used with synchronous APIs like XHR and localStorage
		- no DOM access
		- runs a different thread than  to the main javascript browser context
			
	- Clients 
		- when a serviceWorker is installad over an existing one
	    - the serviceWorker can claim all pages owned by the previous service worker
	    - usually it waits to claim pages until the old serviceWorker is not used by any existing loaded pages


	- `Navigator.serviceWorker` (browser context)
	  - Returns a ServiceWorkerContainer object,
	    - provides access to the ServiceWorker objects for the associated document.
	      - registration
	      - removal
	      - upgrade
	      - communication
	      - state

	      

	- ServiceWorkerRegistration
		- represents a service worker registration

	- ServiceWorkerState
		- state of the service worker



	- ServiceWorkerGlobalScope
		- Represents the global execution context of a service worker.
		- same thing as `self`?


	- SyncManager
		- provides an interface for registering  and listing sync registrations


	- double check the following
		- Client
			- the scope of a client controlled by a service worker
			- either
				- a document in a browser context
				- a SharedWorker

		- WindowClient
			- special type of `Client`
			- scope of a service worker client that is a document in a browser context controlled by the active service worker


		- Clients (worker context)
			- The clients global in the service worker lists all of the active push clients on this machine.
			- represnets a container for a list of Client objects
			- the mainway to access all the clients owned by the active service worker


## cache
  - just use IDB - fuck cache
  - represents the storage for request/response object pairs that are cached as part of the serviceworker lifecycle
  - global object on the service worker that allows us to store assets delivered by responses, and keyed by their requests
  - works in a similar way to the browser’s standard cache, but it is specific to your domain


### CacheStorage
  - the storage for cache objects
  - provides
    - a master directory of all the named caches that a ServiceWorker can access
    - maintains a mapping of string names to corresponding Cache objects


## service workers 
	- [service worker global scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope)
	- [notification click has a really good example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/notificationclick_event)
	- [push event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/push_event)
	- [pushsubscriptionchange is a critical event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/pushsubscriptionchange_event)
	- [clients object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients)
	- [service worker registration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration)
	- [register api, good docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register)
	- [open a window client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients/openWindow)
	- [windowClient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowClient)


### use cases
  - act as a middleware (opportunities are limitless)
  - enable the creation 'of' offline experiences
  - intercept network request
  - react based on network availability
  - background data syncrhonization
  - responding to resource requests from other origins
  - receiving centralized updates to expensive to calculate data
  - client-side compiling and dependency management
  - hooks 'for' background services
  - custom templating based on URL patterns
  - performance enhancments
    - prefecting resources, etc


### lifecycle
	1. registration
		- e.g. `workbox.register()`
		- e.g. `navigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw-test/sw.js', {scope: './sw-test/'})`
			- `register('./path/to/sw.js', {scope: 'relative/to/origin'})
			- in the above example, 'sw-test' is the origin
		- A single service worker can control many pages. 
		- Each time a page within your scope is loaded, the service worker is installed against that page and operates on it.
		- be careful with global variables in the service worker script: each page doesn’t get its own unique worker.
	2. download
	3. install `oninstall` event
		- triggers
		  - when the downloaded file is found to be new/byte-wise different
		- use cases 
		  - populte idb 
		  - fetch resources to cache site assets
		  - i.e. whatever you would do when initialling a mobile app 
		    - e.g. make sure its available offline 
		  - etc
		- installation is not complete until `oninstall` handler completes
	4. activate `onactivate` event
		- triggers
		  - new installation - immediately activated
		  - update installation - activated when there are no longer any pages loaded that are still using the old service worker
		    - force activation 
		      - `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting()` dont wait for existing workers to release claim
		- use cases 
		  - cleanup of resources used in previous service worker versions
		    - e.g. deleting stale idb caches

	5. update
		- triggers
		  - navigation to an in-scope page occurs
		  - event fired on the service worker and it hasnt been downloaded in the past 24 hrs

	6. claiming/controlling of pages 
		- service worker only controls pages opened after the `register()` is successful 
		- scope: 
		  - The path to your service worker file needs to be written relative to the origin, not your app’s root directory
		    - if the worker is at https://mdn.github.io/sw-test/sw.js, 
		    - and the app’s root is https://mdn.github.io/sw-test/.
		    - the path needs to be written as /sw-test/sw.js, not /sw.js.
		  - Each time a page within your scope is loaded, the service worker is installed against that page and operates on it.
		  - each page SHARES the same worker context, watchout for globals
		  - The service worker will only catch requests from clients under the service worker's scope.
		  - The max scope for a service worker is the location of the worker.
		  - If your service worker is active on a client being served with the Service-Worker-Allowed header, you can specify a list of max scopes for that worker.
		- `await clients.claim()` - force new worker to claim existing pages


### tools 
	- [chrome: service workers](chrome://inspect/#service-workers)
	- [more information than inspect](chrome://serviceworker-internals)


### NOTES 
	- `self` and `globalScope` are the same thing 
		- but niether are required, as.... all methods attached to both objects are global
		- get your shiz together MDN!
	- you can react to events in two ways 
		- `self.addEventListener('eventname', (event) => poop)
		- `self.oneventname = (event) => poop
	-  browsers will explicitly disallow notifications not triggered in response to a user gesture.
	- in general horrible cross-browser feature parity 
		- always check to see if every single fucking method works in the environment(s) your supporting
	- in general openWindow/focus can 
		- only be called in response to a notification click
		- only ONE of them can be called
		- you have 10 seconds in the notificationclick handler to run your business logic
		- openWindow/focus must be called before your handler resolves
			- and you must put your handler within event.waitUntil
		- thus 
			- fuck client.focus|openwindow
				- nvm, works perfectly in response to anotification click
			- just show the notification if !client.focused, else show the toast
	

	- TODO 
		- [use cases for navigation preload manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/navigationPreload)
		- [common mistakes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-window#avoiding_common_mistakes)




### service worker examples: mostly browser context
```js
	// focusing on handling registration

			// you can call this without checking for a previous registration
			// but is there benefits to checking?
			// scope === used for navigation matching 
			// only the sw whose scope matches the url will be considered 'controller'
			// an sw cant control a parent path (think rest api paths)
			// so only specify scope if this sw is intended to control a child path
			// the default scope (i.e './') is the service workers location (usually at the root of the site)
			// e.g. if you include a sw at poop.com/toilet
			// its scope will be all paths under the toilet
			const registration = await navigator
				.serviceWorker
				.register('relative/path/to/sw.js', { scope: './' })
			
			// fires whenever a new worker is assigned to registration.installing
			// i.e. if the sw has changed since the last registration

### service worker events: mostly worker context

	event.notification.close() // close the notification
	event.action // the ID of the button on the notification that was clicked
	event.data // poop attached to the event by whatever triggered it


	// each callback  receives an Event of type 'name'
	// which usually has distinct properties/methods + the ones inherited

	// InstallEvent
	self.oninstall = event => {

## push notifications 
	- fuck what they say, the browser has to be open to receive push events
		- however, if a push is sent while the browser is not opened, once opened, it will receive the push event
		- imperative to group the events together so a user doenst get 50mill events
		
### google overlords best practices 
	- use notifications wisely, they should be timely, precise and relevant
		- timeley: displayed at the right time for time sensitive events 
		- precise: offer enough info so that the user can make a decision without clicking through to the app 
		- relevant - make the notification relevant to the users needs
	- never prompt the user to receive notifications as soon as they land on your app
		- they have no context at this time
		- find a more appropritate time to receive notifications
		- e.g. when the user is configuring their communication settings, after the user completes a critical task, when they return to your site (after they are a known user who uses your app)

### terms
	- notification 
		- a message displayed to the user outside of the apps normal UI (i.e. browser)
	- push message
		- a message sent from the server to the client 
	- push notification 
		- a notification created in response to a push message 
		- object displayed in the status bar of a client, e.g. smartphone/browser 
		- can be triggered 
			- locally by an open application, 
			- pushed from from the server to the user even when the app is not running
	- notifications API 
		- an interface used to configure and display notifications to the user 
		- see below
	- push api 
		- an interface used to subscribe your app to a push service and receive push messages in the service worker 
	- web push 
		- an informal term referring to the process or components involved in the process of pushing messages from a server to a client on the web
	- push service 
		- a system for routing push messaages from a server to a specific client 
		- each browser implements its own push service 
			- wtf we have to understand this
			- do we need to handle this distinctly for each browser (duh)
			- remember having to code specifically for ded azz IE? (fuck)
	- web push protocol 
		- describes how an application server or user agent interacts with a push service 
	- subscription
		- created by a service worker
		- creates a unique endpoint + public keys that you can push data to from a backend server
			- each browser creates their own subscription object (endpoint + public keys)


### use cases 
	- let your app extend beyond the browser
	- engage the user outside of the your web app
	- permit the user (through action buttons) to engage with your site/app without needing to go back to your webpage


### flow 
#### setup
	1.	user is asked for and provides consent to receive notifications from your application (granted)
	2.	service worker registration workflow completes 
	3.	service worker creates a push notification subscription and sends the endpoint & public keys it receives to your backend
	4.	your backend saves the subscription endpoint & public keys for later use to push messages back to the service worker


#### pushing: backend -> push service 
	1. use the public keys to encrypt the data you want to send to the user
	2. send the encrypted data to the subscription.endpoint


#### receiving: push service -> user
	1. push service routes the encrypted data to the users device 
	2. the device wakes up the browser (if closed) 
	3. the service worker handles the push event and invokes your business logic which outputs onto the app thread 
	4.	app displays notification to user 
	5.	BOOM


#### key decision points 
	- 	ask user for permission 
		- 	user can press X (DENIED)
		- 	user can deny (DENIED)
		- 	user can grant (SUCCESS)


### key APIs 
	- push sends info to service worker 
	- server displays notification to user


#### service worker api 
	- responds to push message events in the background and relays them to your application 
	- see elseware in this doc for this shit


#### Notifications API
	- the action of the service worker sending the information to a user
	- lets the app display system notifications to the user
	- uses the same mechanisms as a native app (mostly)
	- split into two non technical areas
		- Invocation API 
			- controls how to make yoru notifications appear 
				- styling, vibration, etc
			- invoked from the client / server (if pushed)
		- Interaction API
			- controls what happens when the user engages with the notification 
			- handled in the service worker


#### Push 
	- the action of the server suplying message information to a service worker
	- allows a service worker to display notifications to users even when the browser is not open
	- push service 
		- each browser manages push notifications through their own service
		- architecture 
			- subscription 
				- is specific to each browser 
			- subscription.endpoint 
				- the browsers push service creates an endpoint where you server can send messages to a specific user 
				- the browsers push service maps the endpoint to a specific client,
			- subscription.keys
				- used to encrypt your push messages before sending to the subscription endpoint  (see webpush)
				- you must encrypt your messages before sending to the push service as the push service may not be encrypted (https)


### web push protocol
	- designed to respect the users privacy by keeping users anonymous and not requiring strong authentication between your app and the push service
	- issues with not requiring strong authentication
		- since the push service is not authneticated, it presets a greater risk of DoS attacks
		- any application in possession of the subscription endpoint is able to send messages to your users 
			- never send this back up to the client, only receive it from the client and store it server side
		- theres no way for the push service to send errors to the developer outside of the response-request-cycle


#### VAPID
	- resolution to the issues of the web push protocol not requiring strong authnetication
	-  the publishers optionally identifies them selves via VAPID to the push service
		- the push service can establish behaviorale expctations and contact the publisher when  these expectations are deviated from
		- the publisher provides contact information so that the push service can contact them in case of exceptional situations 
		- precedence is given to publishers by the push service who use their shit, mutha fuckas
		- also allows you to not have to create a firebase project, w00p w00p
	- VAPID process 
		1. create a pub/priv key pair for your server and give the pub key to your web app
		2. when the user accepts to receive notifications, add your pub key to the 'subscribe()' APIs options object
		3. when your app server sends a push message, include a signed JSON web token alon gwith the public key		


#### mozillas webpush nodejs library 
	- handles both encryption and the web push protocol 
	- makes it super easy, fucking use it

### push examples - mostly worker context
```js

				// contains { publicKey, privateKey, andOtherShit? }
