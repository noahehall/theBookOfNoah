# js type systems

- IMO
  - flowtype is best in class
    - type system implemented through annotations
    - no tranpsilation required, simply strip the annotation from code
    - adoption constrained (IMO because of the dev experience)
  - typescript has best dev experience
    - transpiler works amazingly
    - production adoption above 90%
    - js features limited to transpiler implementation
  - rescript
    - if we could make a day 25 hours long, I would consider rescript
    - however I believe (dunno) its focus on nodejs may [limit deno users](https://practicalrescript.com/exploring-rescript-on-deno/)
