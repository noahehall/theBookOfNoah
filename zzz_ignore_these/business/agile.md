# terminology high level
  - software development: process of computer programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks resulting in a software product
    - Types
      - agile Development
      - rapid application Development
      - dynamic systems development method
      - extreme programming
      - feature-driven development
  - rolling wave planning: process of project planning in waves as the project proceeds and later details become clearer
    - work to be done in the near term is based on high level assumptions
    - high level milestones are set
    - as the project progresses, the risks assumptions and milestones originally defined are refined

# agile development


## high level
  - agile development: describe a set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams
  - culture/principles:
    - Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
    - Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
    - Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
    - Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
    - Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
    - Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress
    - Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
    - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    - Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
    - Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
    - Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

  - manifesto for agile software development: best practices for agile development
    - individuals and interactions over processes and tools
      - good team of developers who communicate and collaborate well > team of experts operating in isolation
    - working software over comprehensive documentation
      - Working software > documents to clients in meetings.
    - customer collaboration over contract negotiation
      - directly involve the paying customer/end-users/proxy for them so that requirements can adapted based on feedback
    - responding to change over following a plan
      - focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.
## scrum life cycle
  - product backlog
  - highest-priority reqs pupshed to sprint backlog
  - sprint tasks assigned
  - tasks released
  - repeat 
## overview
  - sprints: short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from one to four weeks.
    - Each iteration involves a cross-functional team working in all functions: planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing.
    - At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly.
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress.

## people
  - product owner: every team should include a customer representative (Product Owner in Scrum).
    -  makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration



## practices
  - acceptance test-driven Development
  - agile modeling
  - agile Testing
  - backlogs
  - behavior-driven Development
  - business analyist designer method
  - continuous Integration
  - cross-functional team
  - domain driven design
  - iterative and incremental Development
  - low-code development platforms
  - pair programming
  - planning poker
  - refactoring
  - scrum events
    - sprint planning
    - daily scrum
    - sprint review and retrospective
  - story-driven modeling
  - test driven development
  - timeboxing
  - user Story
  - velocity tracking
  - project inception: One of the key objectives of a project inception is to collect requirements collaboratively.
  - Story mapping: is an engaging activity where all participants are involved in the process of building the product backlog on a wall, versus writing a dull 100-page requirement document.
    - tool to capture requirements during inception
    - process : vision -> goals > activites -> tasks
      1. define the project vision:
      2. define goals required to achieve vision
      3. define activities required to reach each goal
      4. define tasks/stories required to reach each activity
    - process: User > Goals > User Journeys > Actions > Stories.
    - process: NFR > Requirement > Story.
      - nfr: non functional requirement
  - information radiator: is a (normally large) physical display located prominently near the development team, It presents an up-to-date summary of the product development status.
  - standup: daily scrum: a brief session, team members report to each other:
    - what they did the previous day toward their teams iteration goal
    - what they intend to do today toward the goal
    - any roadblocks/impediments they can see to the goal

## managing the flow of work
### Kanban
  - lean method to manage and improve work across human systems that aims to manage work by balancing the demands with available capacity, and improving the handling of system level bottlenecks

### Scrum
  - scrum: framework for managing software development. designed for teams of 3-9 engineers who:
    - break their work into actions that can be completed within fixed duration cycles called 'sprints'
    - track progress and re-plan in 15-minute stand-up meetings
    - collaborate to deliver workable software every sprint

## common pitfalls
  - lack of overall product design
  - adding stories to an iteration in progress
  - lack of sponsor support
  - insufficient training
  - ineffective product owner
  - unfocused team
  - excessive preparation/planning
  - problem solving in the daily standup
  - assigning tasks
  - scrum master as a contributor
  - lack of test automation
  - allowing technical debt to build up
  - taking on too much in an iteration
  - fixed time, resources, scope, and quality
