# logarithms
  - Recall that logan is the power to which you need to raise a in order to obtain n

  1.loga(nk)=klogan
  2.loga(nm)=logan+logam
  3.nlogab=blogan
  4.loganâ‹…logba=logbn

## first quiz
  - Is it true that (log5n)2=2log5n?
    - no
    - (log5n)2 is just (log5n)(log5n) while log5(n2)=2log5n
