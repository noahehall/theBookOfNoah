# polynomials
## adding and subtracting
  - steps
    1. you can remove the paranthesis if their separted by a +/- sign, make sure to distribute the -1
    2. combine like terms
  - adding polyonimials

    ```
      (x^3+3x-6) + (-2x^2+x-2) - (3x-4)
      x^3+3x-6 -2x^2+x-2 - 3x+4
      x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 4
    ```
  - subtracting polynomials
    ```
      (4x^2y -3xy + 25) - (9y^2x + 7xy - 20)
      4x^2y - 3xy + 25 -9y^2x -7xy + 20
      4x@y - 10xy + 45 - 9y^2x
    ```
## multiplication of binomials and trinomials
  - steps
    1. distribute (i.e. multiply) each term from one into the other
    2. combine like terms
  - special multiplication products
    1. squaring binomials
      ```
        (x+9)^2 = (x+9)(x+9) = x^2 + 18x + 81
        (a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = a^2 + 2ba + b^2

      ```
    2. product of sum and difference
      ```
        (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2
      ```

# [logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/v/logarithms)
  - opposite of exponents
    - YOU NEED TO DO EXPONENTS
  - says `what power do you have to raise to in order to get some other number`
  - rules
    ```
      log(a)(n^k) = klog(a)n
      loga(nm) = log(a)n+log(a)m
      n^(log(a)b) = b^(log(a)n)
      log(a)n * log(b)a = log(b)n
  - examples
    ```
      2^4 = 2 * 2 * 2 *2 = 16
      2^x = 16 === log(2)16 = x
      x = 4
    ```
    ```
      log(3)81
      3^x = 81
      x = 4
    ```
    ```
      log(100)1
      100^x = 1
      x = 0
    ```
    ```
      log(8)2
      8^x = 2
      x = 1/3
    ```
    ```
      log(2)1/8
      2^x = 1/8
      x = - 3
    ```
    ```
    ```
