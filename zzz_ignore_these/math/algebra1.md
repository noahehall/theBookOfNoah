# [polynomials](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-polynomial-expressions)
  - coefficient: the thing that multiples the variable to some power
    ```
      10x^7 #coefficient === 10
    ```
  - poly: greek for many
  - nomial: latin for names
  - polynomial: many terms, with each term having a coefficient multiplied by a variable with a non-negative exponent
    ```
      # valid polynomials
        9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9 #9 === 9x^0
        9a^2 - 5
        10x^7
      # invalid polynomials
        9x^a - 5 # a is a variable
        9x^1/2 - 5 # 1/2 is not an integer
    ```
  - monomial: a single term
  - binomial: two terms
  - trinomial: three terms
  - fucknomial: 2 CHAIIIINZ
  - degree: the exponent, e.g. 10x^7 is a 7th degree term
  - polynomial degree: the highest degree of all terms in the polynomial, e.g. 10x^7 + 10x^2 is a 7th degree polynomial
  - polynomial in standard form: sort the terms from highest to lowest by degree
## simplifying polynomials
  1. add/subtract like terms
    ```
      x^2 + x^2 === 2x^2
      3x^2 + 4x^2 === 7x^2
      x^2 + x^3 === samething, cant be simplified
    ```
# [functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/algebra-functions/evaluating-functions/v/what-is-a-function)
  - function: something that takes an input, process it, and produce a single output (i.e. the same input must always produce the same output )
    ```
      # f of x
      f(x) = { x^2 if x === even, else x + 5 }
        # f of 2
        f(2)
    ```
  - function notation: expressing an equation as a function
    ```
      y = x + 1
      y = f(x) = x + 1
    ```
