- a library of Ethereum smart contracts, to create tokens even more easily

## basics

### example process

- [implemented here](https://github.com/udacity/nd1309-work-code/tree/master/Course_Identity_And_Smart_Contracts/SampleToken)

- Create an ERC-20 token using OpenZeppelin
- Use Truffle to compile and deploy the token contract to a locally running ethereum network
- Use Infura and Truffle to deploy the token contract to the Rinkeby Public Test Network
- Once our contract is deployed on Rinkeby, find our deployed token on Etherscan
- Then, we will use Metamask to import this token
- Finally, we will send the token to any ethereum address using Metamask!
