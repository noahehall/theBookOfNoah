# solidity

- strongly typed language used to develop smart contracts in the Ethereum platform
- there is some overlap with the ethereum.md file, rely on this one more (as it comes straight from solidity docs vs udacity)
- fkn udacity solidity course sucks, just read the docs vs their old azz videos
  - bookmark: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#ternary-operator

## terms

- smart contracts: code that lives on the blockchain, the core of ethereum
  - what differentiates ethereum from bitcoin Script
- blockchain: globally shared, transactional database
  - anyone can read entries in the blockchain by participating in the network
- transaction: changes something in the blockchain
  - i.e. a db transaction, where everything is rolledback when anything fails
  - while a transaction is being applied, no other transaction can alter the blockchain
  - is always cryptographically signed by the sender (creator)
    - ensures that only the person holding the keys to the account can transfer money from it
    - must be included in a block being being added to the blockchain
- block: a bundle of transactions; validated by miners and distributed among all participating nodes
  - if two transactions in a block contradict each other, the one that comes first will succeed and the conflicting transctions discarded
  - blocks are added in ethereum ~17 seconds
- mining: the block selection algorithm
- wei: 10\*\*18 ether
- ether: ethereums currency
- natspec: triple-slash comments `/// like this` that will be shown when the user is asked to confirm a transaction or when an error is displayed
  - should come directly before all fns, state vars, etc
- replay attacks: when a signed message is reused to claim authorization for a second action
  - prevent these by signing the msg with a nonce (number of transactions sent by the account)
  - ^ the smart contract will check if a nonce is used multiple times
  - ReceiverPays smart contract: vulnerable to these type of attacks
    - can occur when the owner deploys the contract, makes some payments, and then destroys the contract
    - later the owner redeploys the smart contract again, but the new instance doesnt know nonces used in the previous deployment, so the attacker can use the old messages with the new contract instance
    - protect against these by
      - including the contract address in the signed message provided to the buyer
      - and ensure a condition exists within the contract that only messages containing the correct address will be accepted

## basics

### installation

#### remix

- remix: recommended for small contract & quickly learning solidity as you dont need to install anything
- can be downloaded for use without an internet connection
- see the remix.md file

#### solc-js

- node module
- has fewer features that solc
- tools expecting `solc` likely arent compatible with `solcjs`

#### solc

- the cmdline compiler
- deriv

```sh
docker run ethereum/solc:stable --help

# install via pkg manager
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```

### best practices

- refunding ether via someAddr.send(someAMount) is a security risk
  - the fn containing this logic could be executed by an untrusted contract
  - instead just keep the refund amount in a variable, and require the recipient to withdraw their money themselves
- in contracts, always zero out any variables holding money after delivery
  - because the recipient could call the fn multiple times

### evm

- ethereum virtual machine: runtime environment for smart contracts
- sandboxed and completely isolated: has no access to network, filesystem or other processes
- is a stack machine
  - all computations are performed on a data area called the stack
  - has a max size of 1024 elements and contains words of 256 bits

### accounts

- external & contract accounts share the same address space
  - treated equally by the EVM
  - has persistent key-value store mapping 256-bit words to 256-bit words called storage
  - balance: balanced in ether denominated in Wei
- external accounts: controlled by public-priate key pairs (i.e. humans)
  - address: determined from the public key
- contract accounts: controlled by the code stored together with the account
  - address: determined at the time the contract is created (derived from the creator address & the number of transactions sent form that address (i.e. the nonce))

### signatures

- ECDSA signatures consit of two params, r and s
  - signatures in ehtereum include a third param called v: used to verify which accounts priate keys was used to sign a message, and the transactions sneder
  - signatures produced by web3.js are the concatenation of r, s and v

### tokens

- ERC-20
- ERC-721
- there are others

### transactions

- a msg sent from one account to another (or to the same account)
- can include binary data (payload) and ether
- if the target account
  - contains code: that code is executed and the payload is provided as input data
  - is not set/null: the transaction creates a new contract account
    - the payload of the contract creation transaction is taken to be EVM bytecode and executed
    - the output data of this execution is permenantly stored as the code of the contract
      - while a contract is being created, its code is still empty
      - ^ do not call back into the contract until its constructor fn has finished exeucting
- ether: the currency of ethereum, can be specified in various denominations (see solidity.syntax)

### message calls

- similar to transactions, in that they have
  - source, target, data payload, ether, gas and return data
- every transaction consists of a top-level msg call which in urn create message calls
- limitations
  - limited to a depth of 1024
    - for complex operations, loops should be preferred over recursive calls
  - only 63/64th of the gas can be forwarded in a message call

#### delegatecall / callcode and libraries

- delegatecall: special variant of a msg call
  - identical to a msg call apart from that fact that
    - the code at the target address is executed in the context (i.e at the address) of the calling contract
    - msg.sender & msg.value do not change their values
- libraries: implemented via delegate calls
  - contract can dynamically load code froma different address at runtime
  - storage, current address & balance still refer to the calling contract
    - only the code is taken from the called addres

#### create

- contracts create other creates via this opcode
- different from normal msg calls in that
  - the payload data is executed
  - the result of the execution is stored as code
  - the caller/creator receives the address of the new contract on the stack

### gas

- upon creation, each transaction is charged a certain amount of gas that has to be paid for by the originator (sender) of the transaction (tx.origin)
  - `gas_price * gas === total cost of tx`
  - ^ has to be paid up front to the EVM executor
  - ^ already used up gas is not refunded on error

#### gas cost tests

- todo

### memory management

- divided into 3 broad categories: memory, storage and callData
- memory: used for fn code execution; is refreshed for each message call
  - fn vars (arguments) are always stored in memory
  - temporary: data is lost after fn execution
  - arrays & structs
  - addressable at byte level
  - reads are limited to a width o 256 bits
  - writes can be either 8 or 256 bits wide
  - at the time of expansion, the cost in gas must be paid
    - is more costly the larger it grows
    - ^ scales quadratically
- storage: for state & local contract-level data, persistent between fn calls and transactions
  - exist for the life of the contract, and stored in the blockchain as part of the contract
  - key-value store that maps 256-bit words to 256-bit words
    - costly to read and write: minimize what you store in only what the contract needs to run
    - contracts can only read & write to its own storage
  - state vs local
    - state vars are defined outside fns
    - local vars always reference state vars
  - persistent:
  - key-value store (256-bit key & value)
  - read/write costly
  - cntract can manage its own data
- callData: like a stack, used for EVM call execution
  - EVM code execution
  - immutable
  - max size 1024, word 256 bit
- best practices
  - derived calculations, caching, and aggregates should be stored outside of the contract

### events

#### logs

- special indexed data structure that maps all the way up to the block level
- used to implement events: when you send an event it creates a log entry
- contracts cannot access log data after it has been created
- log data can be efficiently accessed from outside the blockchain (e.g. by dApps)

### libraries: todo (see link)

### contracts

- if you declara a local variable of contract type (e.g. `ContractName poop`) you can call fns on that contract
- can be instantiated via new
- the data representation of a contract is identical to that of address type, and is also used in the ABI
- the members of contract types are the external fns of the contract, including state variables marked as public
- inheritance
  - supports multiple inheritance by copying code
    - when a contract inherits from other contracts, only a single contract is created on the blockchain
    - and the code from all the base contracts are copied into the created contract
  - two mechanisms
    - interface (abstract) contracts
      - this is how token standards are implemented: if any contract wants to adopt a token, needs to provide the fns defined in the token interface
    - derived contracts
      - last contract in file gets deployed
- ABI: application binary interface
  - dApps use this JSON file as the contracts interface

#### structure

- specify and control the behavior of contracts by breaking them into modules for isolation

#### self-destruct

- the only way to remove code from the blockchain is when a contract performs the `selfdestruct` operations
- the remaining ether is sent to a designated target and then the storage & code is removed from state
  - if someone sends ether to a removed contract the either is lost forever
  - some nodes will still contain the contract in history, so self destructing is not the same as deleting data from a hard disk
- to deactivate a contract you should disable it instead
  - e.g. by changing some internal state which causes all fns to revert when someone attempts to execute them
  - this makes it impossible to use the contract, as it returns ether immediately

#### precompiled contracts

- special contracts whose addresses range between 1 & including 8
- can be called as any other contract but
  - their behavior & gas consumption is not defined by EVM code
  - instead is implemented in the EVM execution environment itself
- different EVM compatible chains may use a different set of precompiled contracts

### keywords, globals, etc

- All identifiers (contract names, function names and variable names) are restricted to the ASCII character set. It is possible to store UTF-8 encoded data in string variables.
- pragma: states which version of solidity to use
  - enables compiler features/checks
  - always local to a source file, so its needed in each file
  - version: should always specify a minimum and a maximum, follows npm semantic versioning
  - ABI coder pragma: select either v1 or v2
    - => 0.8 v2 is auto selected
    - required To use arrays of arrays in external (instead of public) functions, you need to activate ABI coder v2.
- contract: collection of code (functions) and data (state) that resides at a specific address on the chain
  - similar to a class in JS
- constructor: only run when the contract is created and will never be called afterwards
- memory: for fn arg storage
- storage: for state vars
- calldata: for calldata?
- public: makes vars accessible from other contracts
  - automatically creates a getter fn for all vars that are public
- view: only meant to view information
- returns (type): type of object returned by a fn
- event: allows clients to react so specific contract changes
  - events and logs emitted by the contract; dApps can listen for and react to these events
  - you can create a blockchain explorer that tracks transactions & balances
- require: defines conditions that reverts all changes if not met
- error: allow you to provide info about why an operation failed; errors are returned to the caller of the fn
  - runtime error: due to EVM/operations
  - application errors: due to some condition in the contract code/wrong data
    - usese assert, require, and revert global fns
  - error handling: how to handle and communicate errors to the caller of the contract
    - return a value to the communicate the error
    - emit events
    - throw an exception (preferred)
- payable: enables the fn to able to receive ether
  - else you have to use convert an address via `payable(someAddr)` to use the `.send()` fn
- ecrecover: fn that accepts a msg along with the r, s and v params (ECDSA) and returns the address that was used to sign the msg

### compiler

- SMTChecker: provides additional safety warnings by querying an SMT solver
  - has to be enabled when the solidity compiler is built
  - it is activated for the Ubuntu PPA (most versions)
  - not for docker images, wndows binaries, or statically-built linux binaries
  - activated for solc-js via smtCallback (only via node, not the browser)
    - requires an SMT solver to be installed locally
  - `pragma experimental SMTChecker;`

#### optimizer

- todo

#### source files

- source code files end with `.sol`
- the file should always start with an SPDX license identifier
  - the compiler doesnt validate the license is part of the SPDX list, but it does include the supplied stringin the bytecode metadata
  - solidity follows the npm recommendation (see link)
- can contain an arbitrary number of contract definitions, import, pragma, and `using for` directives and struct, enum, function, error and constant ariable definitions
- imports: the solidity compiler extracts away filesystem details to support reproducible builds on all platforms (think windows vs linux paths)
  - VFS: virutal filesystem: mapps import paths to import symbols
    - you can modify the import symbols and paths via the JSON api, e.g. to modify which symbols map to which (and where) import paths

### data types

- division on integers always results in an integer (solidity rounds down)
- Fallback functions provide a safeguard. They are automatically triggered if the function signature does not match any of the function signatures in the smart contract. A contract can have exactly one fallback function. These fallback functions are unnamed.
- "Modifiers can be used to easily change the behavior of functions. For example, they can automatically check a condition prior to executing the function. Modifiers are inheritable properties of contracts and may be overridden by derived contracts.

## algorithms & strategies

- come from `solidity by example`
- but the idea is important: try to find and document other blockchain strategies

### auctions & voting

- [voting example](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#voting)
- [open auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)
  - everyone can see the bids that are made
  - everyone can send their bids during a bidding period (at a certain time the auction ends)
  - the bids include Ether to bind bidders to their bid
  - if the current highest bid is exceeded, the previous highest bidder gets their money back
- [blind auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#id2)
- blind strategy:
  - during the bidding period a bidder doesnt actually send their bid, but only hashed version of it (so its blind)
  - after the bidding period the bidders have to reveal their bids by sending their values unencrypted and the contract checks that the hash value is the same as the one provided during the bidding period
- binding strategy:
  - the only way to prevent the bidder from NOT sending the bid value after the auction ends is to make them send it together with the bid
  - since value transfers cannot be blinded in theithereum, anyone can see the value

### purchases

- simplifest form is a single buyer and single seller that must send an item to the buyer and receive funds in return
- [safe remote purchases](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#id2)
  - both parties put twice the value of the item into the contract as escrow
  - the money is locked until the seller ships the item and the buyer confirms receipt by calling a fn on the contract
  - then the buyer receives 50% back (they put up 2x)
  - then the receiver receives 150% back (they put up 2x + the 50% from the buyer)
  - this incentives both parties to resolve the situation or oyherwise their money is locked forever
- [micropayment channel](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#micropayment-channel)
  - [the implemented contract, must read](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#computing-the-message-)
- payments channel: use cryptographic signatures to make repeated transfers of ether securely, instantaneously and without transaction fees
  - the signature acts like a bank check
  - the only fees occured are when:
    - the sender deploys the created contract to the block hain
    - the receiver executes the contract on the blockchain
  - once the receiver is ready to collect their payment, they call a close method
    - the close method is responsible for actually transfering the funds (via selfdestruct)
    - thus if multiple payments exist, there are accumulative (you receive the last one which contains all the others)
    - the sender is not permitted to call the close fn (as they could use it to cheat the recipient)
- use signatures to authorise transactions via a smart contract
- sender:
  - creates and deploys a contract, that contains
    - enough ether to cover expected payments
    - a fn a recipient can call with the senders signature (see below)
    - the fn will take ether from the senders account and transmit it to the caller
  - sends a cryptographically signed message off-chain (e.g. via email) to the recipient which must include
    - the recipients address
    - the amount to be transferred
    - protection against replace attaacks
- recipient (see web3 docs)
  - is responsible for calling the smart contract fn created by the sender, providing the senders signature
  - since the recipient is calling the fn, they are responsible for paying the transaction fees
  - the recipient needs to:
    - verify the contract address in the message matches the payment channel
    - verify the total on each new payment is the expected amount
    - verify the new accumulative total doesnt exceed the amount of ether escrowed
    - verify the signature is valid and comes from the payment channel sender
- considerations:
  - time to keep the payment channel live
    - for shortlived transactions, e.g. paying for something each minute, it may be shorter
    - for longer term payment channels, e.g. paying an employee, the channel may be kept open for years or months
