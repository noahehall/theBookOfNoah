# ethereum

- open source programmable blockchain platform
- a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts
- a general purpose blockchain, thats built to run anytime of smart contract
  - as opposed to first genertion blockchains, built to execute specific transaction types (e.g. bitcoin === finance)
- characteristics
  - permissionless: anyone can join the networ
  - consensus: PoW, but working towards Proof of Stake
  - scalability: high node scalability, low perf scalability (15s to add a block to the chain)
    - compare that with visa/mastercard, which process about 5k transactions per second
  - regulation: decisions made by core developer group
    - bitcoin uses community driven decision-making
  - anonymity: identities are tied to public keys
  - native currency: ether
  - scripting: turing complete virtual machine

## terms

- turing complete: can execute code
- ether: the cryptocurrency of ethereum
- kill switch: self destructs a smart contract
- patricia tree: data structure; Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Code in Alphanumeric
- gas: the cost of executing transactions on the EVM.
- Wei: smaller denomination of Ether, 1 ether === 10^18 Wei
- Gwei: gigga wei, 6 billion wei
- clients: different ways to interact with the ethereum blockchain
  - geth: go ethereum
  - ethereumjs: javascript client
  - bunch of others as well

## solidity

- check the solidity.verbose & solidity.syntax files
- modeled after cpp, python and javascript, submitted to EVM for execution
- statically typed, supporting inheritance and libraries
- high level language for coding and deploying smart contracts

## EVM: ethereum virtual machine

- a virtual machine that executes logic, algorithms, and processes data inputs; a runtime environment for Smart Contracts
- the operating system of ethereum; all nodes run the EVM
- world computer: all the nodes that run the EVM
- world state: the global state of the ledger
- manages state, transactions, gas and fees; connects to accounts, and
- implemetations (there are many); allows you to access the EVM via various programming languages
  - go-ethereum
  - parity (rust)
  - cpp-ethereum
  - pyethereum
  - ethereumJ (java)

### lifecycle (high level)

- develop & compile
  - write the code (e.g. in solidity)
  - compiled into two views then deployed to the ethereum blockchain
  - assembly view: human readable json ABI (application binary interface)
  - bytecode view: bytecode machine readable
- deploy
  - each deployment creates a new instance of the contract; and you receive an address that points to that instance
  - once deployed the contract is un-editable
- invoke & execute on the EVM
  - via any wallet, whether online, desktop, hardware (ledger, trezor), ordApp
  - you invoke the contract to call the contracts functions
- destroy
  - important to self-destruct the contract so no one can call functions on it anymore
  - contrats also tend to have ether in it, so keeping a contract around (instead of self destructing) puts those funds at risk

## blockchain framework

### state

- separates blockchain state from account states and creates a mapping between them
- blockchain: contains the history of transactions, and links to accounts

### blocks

### blockchain

### network

- mainnet: prod; proof of work
- ropsten: proof of work
- kovan: proof of authority
- rinkeby: proof of authority;
- ethereum network performance metrics (check ethstats link)
  - best block: the highest block number of the longest valid chain
  - uncles: orphaned blocks; in Ethereum they are included and rewarded.
  - last block: the last mined block in seconds
  - avarge block time: the avergae time between two blocks excluding uncles
  - avg network hashrate: # of hashes spent by miners to find a new block, typically shown in terra hashes
  - difficulty: mining difficulty to find the new block
  - active nodes: # of nodes connected
  - gas price: price the miners the currently accepting, default is 20
  - gas limit: gas limit for the block, default is 4 million
    - miners can include transactions until the block is full/gas limit has been met
    - similar to bitcon block size limit
  - block time: the time between blocks
  - difficulty: of prevoius blocks
  - block propagation: how fast blocks are shared between nodes
  - last blocks miners: private key of miners who found the last blocks
  - uncle count: number of uncles per block
  - transactions: number of transactins in the last included block
  -

### mempool

### consensus

### transactions

- transactions result in a change to the world state
  - all transactions need to be signed before sending it to the network
- externally owned account transaction types
  - message calls: recipient can be another EOA or a CA
  - contract creation: recipient is a CA
- gas: the total cost of executing operations on the contract; the cost is converted to ether and sent to the node that executed the transaction
- transaction fields (different between transaction types)
  - nonce: number of transactions in the senders account, incremented by 1, 0-index
  - gas price: price per unit of gas the sender is willing to pay for executing the code in the smart contract; i.e. same as the miner fee in bitcoin
  - gas limit: the maximum amount of gas a sender is will to pay for a given transaction; i.e. the budget
    - the max number of computation steps the transaction is allowed to spend
    - if there isnt enough gas (i.e. exceeds the gas limit) the contract will error, and you'll lose any gas spent before the error is thrown
    - any unused gas will be returned to the sender
  - to: recipient address
  - value: Amount of either in wei
  - optional fields: used to record the creation & execution of smart contracts
    - data: todo
    - init: todo

#### ether

- the native ucrrency of ethereum used to power smart contracts

### wallet

#### accounts

- account state: accounts, addresses, balances, including:
  - Nonce: number of transactions on the senders account
    - EOAs: total transactions that user made
    - CAs: number of times it has deployed/created other smart contracts
  - balance: value of ether available on the account in wei
  - storage hash: root node of the patricia tree
  - code hash: hash of the code within the smart contract; executes everytime a call is made to the contract; cannot change after its deployed
  - account storage
  - ethereum virtual code
- account types
  - EOAs: externally owned accounts;
    - tied to a private key
    - doesnt hold code
    - maintains ether balance
    - can send transactions/transfer between wallets
    - initiate smart contracts
  - CAs: contract accounts;
    - has code thats triggered by transactions/messages
    - controlled by the code contained within smart contracts
    - transfer value, initiate another smart contract, and execute associated smart contracts, manipulate storage
    - abi: application binary interface: javascript representation of the contract

### hashing

### digital signatures

### digital assets

#### smart contract

- applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibilty of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference
  - a contract written in code; to programmatically enforce rules setup in a negotiation between two parties
  - an object on the ethereum blockchain that contains code to be executed by the EVM
  - can store data, execute logic, interact with other smart contracts, and send ether
  - can hold ether just like a wallet, and have an address just like a wallet
- use cases
  - create tokens and facilitate transactions of tokens and record alances of tokens in an account
  - when buying something from a seller, you send the money to the smart contract
    - the smart contract will hold the ether until you receive the stuff
    - once the stuff is received, you update the smart contract and it will send the ether to the seller
- test network: for testing smart contracts via the EVM
- gotchas: once your smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain it cannot be changed!

#### tokens

- built on the ethereum platform
- used for exchanging value between different parties based on rules specified in that tokens smart contract
- represent any fungible (replaceable) tradable good such as coins, loyalty points, gold certificates, IOUs or non fungible goods (unique collectibles) e.g. in-game itmes, etc
- different exchanges may not support all tokens, based on the requirements of the ERC standard the token implemnets (see elseware in this doc)

#### token contracts

- smart contracts that contain a `mapping(address => balance)` and deployed on the ethereum network
  - i.e. maps account addresses to their balances
  - balances can represent anything, a monetary value, license, physical object, etc, determined by the contract creator
  - the unit of this balance is called a token
- token contracts need to follow the ethereum token standard (protocol)

#### EIP

- Ethereum Improvement Proposals
- describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards
  - ERCs are a subset of EIPs

#### ERC

- Ethereum Request for Comments
  - similar to BIPs: Bitcion Improvement Proposals
- technical documents used by smart contract developers
  - e.g some define a set of rules to implement tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
- ethereum token standards: contracts which can be inherited from

#### fungible tokens

- when all tokens are exactly the same and have the same value
- can be exchanged for eachother, e.g. 1 dollar bill always ==== another dollar bill

##### ERC-20

- most popular fungible token standard
- standarization: wallets can show varius token balances and provide an easy transfer of tokens between addresses
  - any application that understands ERC-20, can interact with ERC-20 tokens
  - all they need is the contract address that implements the token
  - only allows transfer of token value (but not the token data?)
- only allows a single token issuance event (thus totalSupply cant be changed)
- mint: creating new tokens to increase the totalSupply
- burn: decrease the totalSupply
  - e.g. by sending them to address 0x0
    - doesnt decrease the totalSupply perse, but it makes the transfered tokens unaivable (because 0x0 owns them)

```js

contract ERC20Interface {
  /** optional fields */

  // keep it short and sweet
  strig public constant name = 'Example ERC-20 Token';
  // similar to a stock symbol
  string public constant symbol = 'POOP';
  // important as ethereum cant deal with decimals, only integers
  // but via this property you can imitate it
  // how divisible a token can be, 18 is common
  // the derived contract would set totalSupply = someAmount * (10 * decimals) in the constructor when creating the token
  uint8 public constant decimals = 18;

  /** required events */
  // emitted when a contract transfers a token
  event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
  // emitted when one address approves another address for spending a specific amount of tokens
  event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);

  /** required fns */

  // maximum supply of tokens that can circulate between addresses
  function totalSupply() public ocnstant returns (uint);
  // # of tokens held by a given address, is viewable by anyone
  // the derived contract uses this to implement the mapping fn
  function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance);
  // the owner manually transfers
  // owner can transfer tokens to another address
  // no checks are made to determine if the recipient is valid (its up to the owner)
  // ^ possible to send to a wrong person, or to an invalid address
  function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
  // enables the smart contract to automate the transfer of tokens on behalf of the owner
  // ^ i.e. the owner approves the contract to send on their behalf
  function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
  // token owner gives approval to another address (e.g. a smart contract) to spend their tokens, up to a certain allowance
  // the other address uses the transferFrom fn
  function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
  // amount of tokens (remaining) allowed to be transfered from an owner by another address
  // generally implemented by a mapping inside a mapping
  function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);
}

```

##### ERC-621

- extension of ERC-20
- adds 2 additional fns to increase/decrease the totalSupply of tokens in circulation
  - increaseSupply
    decreaseSupply

##### ERC-827

- latest (prolly not) improvement to ERC-20
- enables transfer of and approval of tokens to e spent by another on-chain 3rd party
  - so you can transfer token value & token data
  - other applications (e.g. wallets, decentralized exchanges) can reuse tokens

##### ERC-223

- provides the possibility to avoid losing tokens when sent ot a ocntract that cannot deal with sent tokens
- uses less gas than ERC-20 transfer

#### non fungible tokens

- special type of cryptographic token which represent something unique
  - are not interchangable because they all have a different value, e.g. 1 Poop !== 1 Urine, because they
- high level NFT properties
  - unique identifier that is directly linked to one ethereum address
  - not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1, e.g. 1ETH is always === 1 ETH, whereas 1 NFT is never === another NFT
- ownership
  - managed throught the uniqueID and metadata that no other token can replicate
- high level creation (minting) process
  - create a new block
  - validate info
  - record info on the blockchain

##### ERC-721

- every token can have a distinct value
- e.g. to create marketplaces, where goods are represented as distinct tokens with different values

##### POAP: proof of attendance protocol

- collectibles that prove you participated in an event
