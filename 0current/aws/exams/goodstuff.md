- nomenclature and terminology to reuse in book of noah

## terms

- API-First strategy: where each service within their stack is first and always released as an API
- microservice architectural: an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. take a large, complex system and break it down into independent, decoupled services that are easy to manage and extend.

## REST

- Representational state transfer (REST) refers to architectures that follow six constraints:
  - Separation of concerns via a client-server model.
  - State is stored entirely on the client and the communication between the client and server is stateless.
  - The client will cache data to improve network efficiency.
  - There is a uniform interface (in the form of an API) between the server and client.
  - As complexity is added into the system, layers are introduced. There may be multiple layers of RESTful components.
  - Follows a code-on-demand pattern, where code can be downloaded on the fly (in our case implemented in Lambda) and changed without having to update clients.
