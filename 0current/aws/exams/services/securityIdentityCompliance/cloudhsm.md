## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

- Generate and use cryptographic keys on dedicated FIPS 140-2 Level 3 single-tenant HSM instances.
- Manage HSM capacity and control your costs by adding and removing HSMs from your cluster.
- Encrypt data at rest
- Confirm web service identities and establish secure HTTPS connections over the internet using SSL and TLS.
- Secure and house your private keys, and sign certificate requests, so you can act securely as an issuing certificate authority (CA).
- Store the transparent data encryption (TDE) encryption key for supported Oracle database servers.
- backup and shut down HSMs when theyâ€™re not needed.

### pricing

- pay an hourly fee for each HSM you launch until you terminate the HSM.
