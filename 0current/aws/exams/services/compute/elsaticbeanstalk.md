# elastic beanstalk

- platfgorm for deploying and managing applications without managing/provisioning infrastructure

## my thoughts

- heroku for aws

## links

- [advanced environment and configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html)
- [supported platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/platforms/platforms-supported.html)

## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

- platform as a service: lol drag n drop your application
- quick deployments
- 0 infrastructure management but you can still pick an instance type, choose db, autoscaling, etc
- supports bunchets of stuff: most importantly packer and multicontainer docker

### pricing

## terms
