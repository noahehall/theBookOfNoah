# DocumentDB (with mongodb compatibility)

- fully managed document db for mongodb workloads where the storage and compute are decoupled, allowing each to scale independently.
- targets content management systems, user profiles, etc

## best practices

### anti patterns

## features

### pricing

- based on 4 dimensions
  - on demand instances: amount of compute instances for a cluster; price per second with 10-minute minimum
  - db i/o: amount of i/o used for R/W; price per million i/os
  - db storage: data stored in clusters storage volume; price per gb/month
  - backup storage: amount of backup stored used in excess of clusters db storage usage; price per gb/month
