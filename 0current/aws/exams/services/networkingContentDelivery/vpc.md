# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- logically isolated virtual network

## my thoughts

- everything starts and ends with vpc
- defining subnets sucks

## links

- [landing page](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/?did=ap_card&trk=ap_card)
- [default vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html)

### integrations

- [lambda: access to vpc resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html)
- [lambda: vpc endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc-endpoints.html)

## best practices

- never use the default VPC for anything

### anti patterns

## features

- secure and monitor connections, screen traffic and restrict instance access
- customize the IP address range, manage subnets and configure route tables
- enforce rules on in/outbound connections
- define network connectivity and restrictions between resources
