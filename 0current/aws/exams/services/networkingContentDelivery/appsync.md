- Connect apps to data and events with secure, serverless, and performant GraphQL and Pub/Sub APIs

- [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/welcome.html)

## best practices

- appsync websockets are simpler to implement than API gateway websockets
  - appsync: less API calls with client-side filtering
  - api gateway: fine grained api management, can also use rest

### anti patterns

## features

- combine APIs into a single merged API
- create realtime experiences by publishing data from any event source to subscribed clients through serverless websocket
- builtin security, monitoring logging and tracing
- optional caching for low latency
-

### pricing

- billed separately for query and data modification operations, and for relatime updates on data
