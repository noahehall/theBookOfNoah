## features

- Streamline operations, implement custom traffic routing rules, and configure and standardize how traffic flows between your services.
- Capture metrics, logs, and traces from your applications to quickly identify and isolate issues and optimize your application.
- Enhance network security with authentication controls and encrypted requests between servicesâ€”even within your private network.

### pricing

- There is no additional charge for using AWS App Mesh
- pay only for the AWS resources (ec2/fargate cpu & memory) consumed by the lightweight proxy that is deployed alongside your containers.
