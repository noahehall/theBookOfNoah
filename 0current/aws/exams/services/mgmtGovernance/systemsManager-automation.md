## features

- use predefined playbooks, or you can build, run, and share wiki-style automated playbooks
- run shell scripts as part of a playbook, actions such as approvals, AWS API calls, or commands on EC2 instances.
- playbooks can be scheduled in a maintenance window, AWS/multicloud/onpremise resource events, or executed directly through the AWS Management Console, CLIs, and SDKs.
- track the execution of each step, require approvals, incrementally roll outs, and automatically halt if errors occur.
