      - top: virtual machine(s)
      - hypervisor: virtual machine adminsitration layer
      - storage resources
      - compute resources
      - bottom: physical server
    - AWS services model
      - AWS services via virtualization: computational power, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile and devel0per tools, administration of management of those services, etc

    - AWS services gotcha
      - services have specific details regarding how they function, and if they function, aross availability zones and regions
    - AWS managed services
      - TODO
    - Working with AWS:
      - aws management console
        - web accessible interface for doing nearly everything within AWS
        - you should build up a suite of your own bookmarked dashboard on cloudwatch and frequently used commands scripts
      - aws CLI
        - ability to interact with deployed applications quickly, with a common set of tasks you prefer to perform outside of the AWS management console

## AMAZON CLOUDWATCH

    - STUDY
      - what is amazon cloudwatch
      - how do you monitor in AWS using cloudwatch (how does it work)
      - what are the types of cloudwatch monitoring
      - what metrics does cloudwatch provide
      - how does aws define mointoring, and how does aws virtualization help and limit what can and cannot be monitored
      - what structures does aws offer through cloudwatch events, alarms, and the wiring between these two mechanisms
      - how do you monitor compute resources like ec2 instances
      - how to monitor storage, from s3 to rds to dynamodb and what aws provides beyond simplistic metrics
      - what does aws provide to make reporting, grouping and interpreting the responses from monitoring metrics an integrated part of a sysop job and workspace

    - cloudwatch: most important tool for a sysops admin
      - a robust system for managing metrics
      - ensure things are not going wrong, or responding when they do
      - should be your first stop in seeing whether your application is healthy
      - gives you awindow into the applications for which your responsible
      - aggregated predefined and custom metrics on cloud and on premise systems into a unified vision of your running systems


    - cloudwatch metrics
      - a measure/facet of an event
        - e.g. how manny bytes received in a given period of time
        - the event is the byte being set, now how many are sent
      - anything that can be tracked
      - usually discreet: a number/percentage value
      - a time-ordered set of data points; i.e. reported repeatedly over time
      - an objective number that tells you how something is performing, based on  the acceptable threshold for that number
      - basics like cpu usage and network latency
      - custom crafted application specific metrics
        - behave just as predefined metrics
        - are added to the event repository alongside standardized metrics and can be analyzed and interpreted
      - on premise metrics
        - report on onpremise applications and systems in a hybrid environment
          -
      - almost all aws services and resources provide metrics to cloudwatch

      - cloudwatch namespaces for metrics
        - container for a collection of related cloudwatch metrics
        - because many metrics share a general purpose
          - use namespaces to distinguish related events from each other
        - custom metrics you create can be placed in predefined or custom namespaces
        - custom namespaces
          - best practice to keep namespace names specific, useful and succinct
            - e.g. yourcompany/namespacename/custommetricname
          - dont do this
            - obscure namespace names
            - codenames that refer to internal applicatins/systems
            - acronyms
        - AWS provides various predefined namespaces
          - format: aws/SERVICE/METRICNAME = the entire namespace composed of the service name and metric name
            - e.g. aws/ec2//cpuutilization vs aws/dynamodb/cpuutilization
            - this distinguishes the same metric name cpuutilization used by various services
            - thus when your selecting a metric, be sure to understand which service its being used by

      - cloudwatch dimensions for metrics
        - a name/value pair that helps identify a metric
        - can create up to 10 dimensions
        - dimensions applied to metrics help to separate the metric from other similar metrics
          - e.g. having dimensions that can classify metrics based on the ec2 instance ID/type

      - cloudwatch statistics for metrics
        - a value that gives you some sense of a particular metric(s) over time
        - can be applied to a subset of all metrics based on dimension(s)
          - e.g.the average for all metrics reported on instances with the dimension X and dimension Y
        - default statistics provided by AWS
          - minimum: over a period, the lowest reported value
          - maximum: over a period: the highest reported value
          - sum: provides the sum of all reported metric values over a period of time
          - average:the mean; the sum/samplecount for a period of time
          - samplecount: the total number of reported data points for this statistic set
          - pnn.nn: the value of a specified percentile, e.g. p99.99 or p50

      - cloudwatch metrics for specific services
        - compute metrics
          - are recorded for 15 months to provide access to historical data
          - recorded in 5 minute increments
            - can increase this frequency to one-minute increments by turning on detailed monitoring
              - activated through the console: select instance > actions> cloudwatch monitoring > enable detailed monitoring

          - EC2 instance metrics
            - important metrics
              - cpuutilization: the percentage of allocated compute units that are currently in use
              - diskreadops: a count of completed read operations from all instance store volumes available
              - diskwriteops: counterpart to diskreadops; a count of completed read operations from all instance store volumes available
              -  diskreadbytes: bytes read from all available instance store volumes
              -  diskwritebytes: the total of all bytes written to instance store volumes available
              -  networkin: total bytes received on all network interfaces
              -  networkout: total bytes sent out across all network interfaces on the instances

    - cloudwatch events
      - is predefined and is something that happens
        - usually related to a metric changing/reported
        - e.g. bytes being receive by a network interface
      - can trigger further action; similar to a cloudwatch alarm
      - typically streamed into cloudwatch
      - CWE: cloudwatch event
        - the specific name for a stream of events being sent into cloudwatch
        - the formal mechanism through which events (lowercase e) get into cloudwatch
        - key components of CWE
          - event
            - the thing being reported; and is a proxy for that thing happening
          - target
            - typically a piece of in lambda/auto scaling group/an email that should be sent out/etc
            - i think this is the action that should be taken when an event matches a rule, and the rule says when this, do that
          - rule
            - an expression that matches incoming events
            - if a rule matches an event; the event is routed to a target for processing


    - cloudwatch alarms
      - used for monitoring any metric reporting in your account and related to a specific application
        - i.e. monitor specific metrics for specific application needs
      - alarm occurs when a metric has reported a value/result outside of a predefined threshold or reseult set
      - the alarm indicates that something needs to happen, not necessarily that something is wrong
        - depends on how you define the threshold
      - process
        - create a set of okay values; attach an alarm to those values, and then respond to that alarm
      - alarm responses
        - running a piece of code in lambda
        - sending a message to an auto scaling group to scale in
        - sending out an email via the aws sns service

    - cloudwatch alarms vs cloudwatch events
      - i.e. when to use what
      - alarms are for monitoring metrics related to specific application needs
      - events describe change in AWS resources
        - i.e. logs reporting on the general health of your application
          - but not specific needs like alarms

    - monitoring on aws
      - negatives
        - with no accessibility to a datacenter, physical hardware, or racks of storage and networking equipment,
          - you are unable to check and see if things are misbehaving at this level
          - thus this is AWS responsibility based on the shared responsibility model
        - cloudwatch functions below the aws hypervisor
          - i.e. either below/at the virtualization layer of aws
          - it cannot report on what is happening above this layer
          - cannot tell you what tasiks/application processes are affecting performance
            - it can only report on the information it can directly see at the hypervisor layer, or things that are reported to it
            - e.g. it cant tell you about disk usage or memory, unless you write code that checks disk usage and send that metric to cloudwatch
      - positives
        - all monitoring is event driven
          - event:
            - something that happens in AWS and is captured
            - triggered in response to actions within an aws environment
    - common events
      - createVolume: when a new ebs volume is created
