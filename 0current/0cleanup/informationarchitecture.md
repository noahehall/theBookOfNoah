    - main page, navigation bar, links, content pages, sitemap, site index, search etc
  - dimensions
    - multidimensional information space with hypertextual navigation
  - boundaries
    - fairly intangible with fuzzy borders that bleed information into other sites

  - heterogeneity
    - huge diversity of media types, documdnts, and file formats
  - centralization
    - often very decentralized operations, with subsites maintained independently
    -

# knowledge management

- develop tools, processes and incentives to encourage people to share that stuff
- tackling tough issues surrounding corporate culture such as
  - informatino hoarding
  - not-invent-here syndrom

# information architects

- main goals
  - organize huge amounts of information so that people can actually find what theyre looking for, think of an internet librarian
  - make it easy for customers to find products, a kind of one-to-one marketing
  - takes on the information overload problem that everyones always complaining about
  - portrays a snapshot/spatial view of an information system
  - focus on making content and knowledge more accessible
  - do your best to learn about users major information needs and information seeking behaviors
    - a better understanding of what users actually want from your site will help you determine and prioritize which architectual components to build
  - structuring
    - involves determining the appropriate elevels of granularity for the information atoms in your site and deciding how to relate them to one another
  - organizing
    - involves grouping those components into meaningful and distinctive ategories
  - labeling
    - means figuring out what to call those categories and the series of navigation links that lead to them
  - findability
    - critifal success factor for overall usability
    - if users can find what they need through some combiantion of browsing, searching and asking then the site fails
    - tools
      - taxonoomies
      - search engines
  - managing information
    - must balance the needs of users with the goals of the business
    - efficient content management and clear policies and procedures are essential
  - art and science
    - the practice of information architecture has lots of ambiguity and complexity
- what its NOT
  - graphic design
  - software devlopment
  - usability engineering
- main tasks
  - creation of categories
  - choice of labels
  - rely on developers to bring their ideas to fruition

## challenges

- ambiguity
  - classification systems are built upon the foundation of language and language is ambiguous
  - words are capable of being understood more than one way
  - not only do we need to agree on the labels and their definitions we also need to agree on which documents to place in which categories
- heterogeneity
  - refers to an object or collection of objects composed of unrelated or unlike parts
  - makes it difficult to impose any single structured organization system on the content
  - homogeneous
    - refers to something composed of similar or identical elements
- internal politics
  - you have to be sensitive to your organizations political environment

## specializations

- thesaurus designer
- search schema content editor
- metadata specialist
- content manager
- information architecture strategist
- manager, information architecture
- director, user experience

-

## costs and value propositions

- cost of finding information
  - if you can save every employee X minutes per day struggling to find answers on your intranet
  - cost of frustrating your customers with a poorly organized site
- cost oof not finding information
  - how many bad decisions are made every day inn your organization because employees didnt find the information they needed
    - how much duplication of efforts results from this disconnect
  - how many customers did you lose because they cant find the product they want
  - how much do you spend on customer support because existing customers hate navigating yoru technical-support database
- value of education
  - the value of educating yoru customers about new prodcuts and services related to the ones theyre actively seekinng
- cost of constructioon
  - what does it cost to design and build a website
  - how much does it cost to redo it six months later because it didnt support findability or doesnt scale
- cost of maintenance
  - what does it cost to ensure that good designs dont crumble over time
  - will the people who maintain the site know where to put new content and when to remove outdated content
- cost of training
  - what does it cost to train employees to use your system
  - how much could you save if it wasnt so complicated to use
- value of brand
  - no matter how beautiful your website is
    - if customers cant find what they need, your brand loses value

## IA concepts

- complex systems are a mix of content, context and users
  - form the basis of the IA model for practicing effective information architecture design
  - you cant design useful information architectures in a vacuum
    - need to understand the business goals behind the website
    - the resources available for the design and implementation
    - be aware of the nature and volume of content that exists
      - and how it may change a year from now
    - learn about the needs and information seeking behaviors of the sites major audiences
- IA is often invisible work
  - the interface is the tip of the pyramid
  - infromation architecture is the foundation of the interface
- knowledge networks
  - IA creates documents to connect people with content

### content

- broadly inclues documents, applications, services, schema, and metadata that people need to use or find on your site
- volume
  - how much content exists
  - how many applications
  - how many pages
  - how many documents
  - i.e. how big is your site
- dynamism
  - what is the rate of growth/turnover
  - how much new content will be added next year
  - how quickly will content go stale ?
- existing structure
- ownership
  - who creates and owns the content
  - is ownership centralized within a content authoring group
  - is ownership distributed among functional departments
  - how much content is licensed from external information vendors
- format (of content/information)
  - document/data types
  - databases
  - product catalogs
  - PDF
  - video
  - etc
- structure (information is organized/ranked/etc)
  - all documents are not created equal
  - an important memo may be fewer than 100 worods
  - a technical manual may be mmore than 1000 pages
- metadata
  - to what extend has metadata that describes the content and objects within your site already been created
  - have documents been tagged manually or automatically
  - whats the level of quality and consistency
  - is there a controlled vocabulary
  - are users permitted to supply their own folksonomic tags to content
  - heavily impacts both information retrieval and content management
  -

### context

- all websites and intranets exist within a particular business/organizational context
  - mission statement
  - strategy
  - staff
  - processes and procedures
  - physical and technology infrastructure
  - budget
  - business goals
  - funding
  - politics
  - culture
  - technology
  - resources
  - constraints
- the vocabulary and structure of your site is a major component of the evolving conversation between your business and your customers and employees
- provides a tangible snapshot of your organizations mission, vision, values, strategy and culture

### users

- differences in customer preferences and behaviors within the physical world translate into different information needs and information seeking behaviors in the context of websites
  - do you know whos using your site?
  - how theyre using it?
  - what information they want from your site?
- to think about
  - audience
  - tasks
  - needs
  - information seeking behavior
  - experience
- goals
  - start with users and the reason they come to a site in the first place
    - they have an information need
    - information needs can vary widely, and each type of informatioo need causes users to exhibit specific information seeking behaviors
      - seeking something you need (e.g. a phone number) is far different information need that learning about a topic
      - searching for something you know is very different behavior that browsing for the unknown
      - your designs should reflect this difference

#### researching users information needs and seeking behaviors

- bottom up information architecture
  - by supporting searching and browsing, the structure inherent in content enables the answers to users questions to rise to the surface
  - content structure, sequencing and tagging
  - answers the following questions
    - where am i
    - whats here
    - where can i go from here
  - is important because users are increasingly likey to bypass your sites top down information architecture
    - using websites and tools like google search
    - click through ads
    - clicking links while reading your content via their aggregators
      - for all the aforementioned reasons, you need bottom up informatioon architectgure
- top down information architecture
  - anticipating users information needs and building off those assumptions
  - determine the most common questions and design the site to meet those needs
    - where am I
    - i know what im looking for; how do I search for it
    - how do I get around this sites
    - whats important and unique about this organization
    - whats available on this site
    - whats happening there
    - do they want my opinion about their site
    - how can I contact a human
    - whats their address
- search analytics
  - based on a high volume of real user data
    - however it doesnt provide an opportunity to interact with users and learn more about their needs directly
  - involves reviewing the most common search queries on your site to diagnose problems with
    - search performance
    - metadata
    - navigation
    - content
  - researching log files
  - provides a sense of what users commonly seek and can help inform your understanding of their information needs and seeking behaviors
  - useful for developing task analysis exercises
- contextual inquiry
  - a user research method with roots in ethnography
  - allows you to observe how users interact with information in their natural settings
  - ask users why there are doing what they are doing while they are doing it
- task analysis
- surveys
- focus groups

#### information needs

- users are essentially looking for ideas and concepts that inform us and help us make decisions

- known-item seeking, i.e. the perfect catch

  - you know what youre looking for, what to call it, and wheere youll find it
  - e.g.
    - what is the population of san francisco
  -

- exploratory seeking, i.e. lobster trapping

  - is usually open-ended, there is no clear expectation of a 'right' answer,
    - nor do you know how to truly articulate what youre looking for
      - if you did, it would be known-item seeking
  - your not exactly sure what your looking for
    - in reality your looking to learn something from the process of searching and browsing
  - when youre looking for more than just a single answer
  - you dont really know much about what youre looking for and arent ready to commit to retrieving anything more than just a few useful items/suggestions of where to learn more
  - you hope that whatever you find will be useful and if it is, thats good enough
  - e.g.
    - find out about good bed and breakfasts inns in some city
    - you want to learn something new about some topic
    - you need to get a sense of what sort of financial plans can help you save for retirement

- exhaustive research, i.e. indiscriminate driftnetting
  - you want to leave no stone unturned in your search for information on a topic
  - you want to know everything about a topic
  - you usually have many weays to express what your looking for,
  - hopefully you have the patience to construct a search using all the various terms
  - e.g.
    - research for a doctoral thesis
    - performing comopetitive intelligence analysis
    - learning about some medical condition
- re-finding, i.e. ive seen you before, moby dick
  - information that youd prefer to never lose track of,
  - youll bookmark it so you can find it again

#### information seeking behaviors

- information seeking behavior
  - users iteratively search, ask, browse, repeat
    - enter queries in search systems
    - browse from link to link
    - ask humans for help
      - email, chat interfaces, etc
  - you must undestand information needs and information seeking behaviors
    - your designs/architecture should reflect your understanding
  - integration
    - often integrate searching, browsing and asking in the same finding session
  - iteration
    - we dont always get things right the first time
    - our information needs may change along the way, causing us to try new approaches with each new iteration

## information models

- modeling users needs and behaviors forces us to ask questions about

  - what kind of information the user wants,
  - how much information is enough
  - how the user actually interacts with the architecture

- too-simple model

  - algorithm
    1. user asks a question
    2. something happens (e.g. searching/browsing)
    3. user receives the answer
    4. done
  - issues
    - users rarely find what there looking for (especially if they are browsing)
    - users often complete their efforts at finding information in a state of partial satisfaction/outright frustration
      - I was able to find information on X, but I was really looking for Y
        - X may satisfy the users needs somewhat, but it still wasnt the perfect solution
    - only focuses on what happens while the user is interacting with the information architecture
      - ignores the information needs context
        - all the related stuff that happens before and after the user ever touches the keyboard
      - assumes an ignorant user who brings llittle/any prior knowledge to the table
  - use cases
    - when users know what there looking for

- berry picking model

  - users start with an information need
  - formulate an information request (i.e. query)
  - move iteratively through an information system along potentially complex paths, picking bits of information (i.e. berries) along the way
  - in the process they modify their information requests as they learn more about what they need and what information is available from the system
  - supporting users with berry picking information needs
    - look for ways to support moving easily from search to browse and back again
    - ability to search within the subcategories you find through browsing
    - browse through categires you find by searching

- pearl growing model

  - users start with one or a few good documents that are exactly what they need
  - they want to get 'more like this one'
  - supporting users with pearl growing information needs
    - allow users to do just that, provide a command called 'similar pages' next to each search result
    - allow users to link from a 'good' document to documents indexed with the same keywords
    - allow users to navigate to items that share somethign in common

- two step model
  - when users are confronted with a site consisting of links to perhaps hundreds of departmental subsites
  - step one
    - users first need to know where to look for the information they need
    - they might search or browse through a directory until they find a good candidate or two
  - step two
    - looking for information within those subsites
  - the users information seeking behavior may be radically different for each of these two steps
    - the information architectures typically of portals are usually nothing like those of departmental subsites

## visualing information architecture

- the sites visual designs
- colors
- typeface images
- information design
  - number of columns
  - column widths
  - changes throughout
- interaction design
  - mouseovers
  - pull-down menus
  -

## deliverables

  - content

    - users need to be able to find content before they can use it
      - findability precedes usability
    - document/data types, content objects, metadata, volume, existing structure
    - heuristic evaluation
      - an expert critique that tests a website against a formal/informal set of design guidelines
      - provides a top down understanding of a sites organization and navigation structures
      - should occur before a review of background materials to avoid bias
      - try to learn from the existing site and identify
        - whats worth keeping
        - major problems
        - what can be improved
      - general guidelines
        - the site should provide multiple ways to access the same information
        - indexes and sitemaps should be employed to supplement the taxonomy
        - the navigation system should provide users with a sense of context
        - the site should consistently use language appropriate for the audience
        - searching and browsing should be integrated and reinforce each other
    - metadata
      - structural
        - describe the information hierarchy of each object
        - is there a title, discrete sections, etc
      - descriptive
        - think of all the different ways you might describe each object
        - topi, audience, format ?
      - administrative
        - desscribe how each object relates to the business context
        - who created it, who owns it, when was it created, should it be removed?
    - content analysis

      - provides a bottom up understanding of content objects
      - careful review of the documents and objects that actually exist
        - top questions
          - individual content objects
            - what is this content
            - how can I describe it
            - what distinguishes this content from others
            - how can I make this content findable
          - groups of content objects
            - look for patterns and relationships that emerge

        - source
          - what are the sources of content
        - subject
          - does the site have a topical taxonomy
          - try to find a publicly available classification scheme/thesaurus for the industry
      - informal surveys or detailed audits

    - content mapping
      - a visual representation of existing information environment
      - goal
        - understand the structure, organization and location of existing content
        - spark ideas about how to provide improved access
        - involves breaking down or combining existing content into content chunks that are useful for inclusion in your site
        -
      - defines
        - content chunks
          - the most finely grained portion of content that merits or requires individual treatment
          - ask the following questions for each of content
            - should this content be divided into smaller chunks that users might want to access separately
            - what is the smallest section of content that needs to be individually indexed
            - will this content need tob e repurposed across multiple documents or as part of multiple proesses
        - content sources
        - content model
          - micro information architectures made up of small chunks of interconnected content
            - helps provide an IA for small chunks of related content
            - useful for displaying multiple items in a similar fashion
            - once the content is displayed in similar fashion you can also link to them from each other
              - e.g. if your viewing a pair of pants, you can have a 'view more like this' link
          - support the critical missing piece in so many sites
            - contextual navigation that works deep within the site
          - primary deliverables
            - a useful IA delierable that informs the design of contextual navigation deep within a site
            - content modeling forces you to determmine which content is the most important content to model
            - forces you to choose which of the many metadata attributes are the ones that will make your content model operational
        - content types
        - content templates
        - content ownership
        - publishing process

          - encourages transition from broad genrealizations to specific actional definitions
          - challenges embedded assumptions (we should be like amazon)
          - avoid copying the wrong features for the wrong reasons
          - establishes current position with respect to competitors and creates a point of reference against which to measuure speed of improvement
      - before and after
        - comparisons between different versions of a single site
        - useful in answering return on investment questions
          - what was the reduction in average time finding core documents
          - has the redesign improved customers ability to find products
          - what aspects of the redesign had a nagative impact on user efficiency or effectiveness
        - use cases
          - identifes and prioritizes information architecture features in the existing site
          - encourages transition from broad generalizations (the nav sucks) to specific actionable definitions (we need to change X, Y, Z)
          - creates a point of reference against which you can measure improvements
      - quantitative
        - number of seconds to perform a task using competing sites

#### strategy

- IA strategy

  - high level conceptual framework for structuring and organizing a website
  - provides a firm sense of direction and scope necessary to proceed into the design and implementation phases

- IA strategy process

  - think - convert research data to creative ideas
  - articulate - conceptual diagrams, metaphors, stories, blueprints, wireframes, etc
  - communicate - present, react, brainstorm
  - test - prototypes

- IA strategy deliverables
  - IA strategy report
    - the most detailed and comprehensive articulation of IA

        - a few rules that must be folloed while mainntaing and changing the site
          - e.g. how to add new content to ensure the continued integrity of the organization, labeling, navigation and indexing systems
      - guidelines
        - suggest (but dont mandate) how the information architecture should be maintained
      - maintenance procedures
        - regular tasks that are required for the sites survival should be fully documented
          - e.g. when and how to add new items to a controlled vocabulary
      - pattern library
        - documents and provides access to reusable aspects of the sites design
      - design process artifacts
        - blueprints, wireframes, controlled vocabulary infomation, etc, anything that can be reused throughout the sites lifetime
      - how a site is organized,
      - why its organized that way,
      - who its for,
      - how the architecture should be extended as the site grows
    -
- top down perspective
  - defines the highest two or three levels of the sites organization and navigation structures
- bottom up perspective
  - suggests candidate document types and rough metadata schema
  - provides a high level framework for the information architecture
    - establishes a direction and scope that will guide the project through implementation
- recommendations

      - collaborative filtering
      - ppersonalization
  - top down or bottom up emphasis
    - bottom up
      - if there is already a solid top down IA or strong interaction design team
  - organization and labeling systems (top down)
    - defining the major organization schemes for the site
      - e.g. users must be able to navigate by product, task and customer category
    - identifying the dominant organiztion scheme to search as the primary hierarchy
  - document type identification (bottom up)
    - idetnifying a suite of document and object types in coordination with content atuhoring and management teams
      - e.g. articles, reports, white papers, etc

    - the definition of administrative, structural and descriptive metadata fields
    - globally
      - applied to every document
    - locally
      - applied to documents within a particular subsite
    - specifically
      - only for a particular document type
  - navigation system design
    - explain how the integrated and supplemental navigation systems will leverage the top down and bottom up strategies
      - search zones may allow users to leverage the top down product hierarchy
      - fielded searching may allow users to search for a particular thing
    - understand implications for customization and personalization capabilities

#### design

- shape the high level strategy into an information architecture
- the very act of shaping ideas into the more formal structure of a blueprint to become realistic and practical
- blue prints

  - show the relationship between pages and other content components
  - can be used to portray organization, navigation and labeling systems
  - often referred to as site maps
  - help determines where content should go and how it should be navigated within the context of a site, subsite or collection of content
  - types
    - big pictures, 100000 foot view, high level
      - most useful for exploring primary organization schemes and approaches
      - great for simulating discussions focsed on the organization and management of content as well as on the desired access pathways for users
    - site navigation
    - content filtering process
    - task-oriented feature explanations
    - user engagement evolving through deeper user of the site type of blueprint
    - detailed
      - map out the entire site so that the production team can implement your plans to the letter without requiring involvement during production
        - all pages
        - all features
        - all organization and labeing, and navigation systems

- wireframes

  - depict how an individual page or template should look from an architectural perspective
  - describe the content and IA to be included, however, confined to a 2d space
  - stand at the intersection of the sites IA and its visual and information design
  - helps the information architect decide on how to
    - group content components
    - how to order components
    - and which component groups have priority
  - types
    - low fidelity
      - no graphic elements and no real content
      - enables the visual designer to focus attention on the global, local and contextual navigation elements of the page
    - medium fidelity
      - has a high degree of detail
    - high fidelity
      - presents a close approximation of what the page will actually look like
      - advantages
        - the congtent and color bring the page to life, helpinng to capture the attention of clients and colleagues
        - by simulating the actual page width and font size the wire frame forces you to recognize the constraints of an html page
        - the fidelity is sufficient to support paper prototype testing with users
  - best practices
    - provide multiple views of an IA
      - dont try to show all things at once
    - develop each view for a specific audience if possible
  - guidelines
    - consistency is key especially when presenting multipe wireframes
    - use multiple layers so you dan reuse navigation bars and other page layout items for multiple pages throughout the site
    - should be useable and professionally developed
    - establish procedures for developing , sharing and maintaining common templates and stenciles

- diagrams

  - useful for communicating the two basic aspects of an informatioon systems structural elements
    - content components
      - what constitutes a unit of content and how those components should be grouped and sequenced
    - connections between content components
      - how components are linked to enable navigating between them

- metadata schema
- design collaboration
  - design sketches
    - design team develops a sense of the desired graphic identity or look and feel
    - technical team assesses the information technology infrastructure of the organization and the platform limitations and whats possible with respect to product features
    - the architect designed the high level information architecture for the site
    - use cases
      - pool the collective knowledge of all teams in a first attempt at interface design for the top level pages of the site
  - web based prototype
    - digital renditions show how the site will look and function
    - are concrete jand often aesthetically compelling
  - point of production information architecture
    - many decisions must be made during production
-

- best practices
  - provide multiple views of the IA
    - a single diagram will always fail
    - the combination of multiple diagrams is best
    - content components
      - what constitutes a unit of content and how those components should be grouped and sequenced
    - connections between content components
      - how components are linked to enable navigating between them
  - develop each view with specific audiences in mind
    - upstream stakeholders/executives
    - downstream designers and developers

#### implementation

    - designs are put to the test as the site is built, tested and launched
    - organizing and tagging documents,
    - testing and troubhleshooting
    - developing documentation and training programs to ensure the IA can be maintained effectively over time
    - detailed blueprints
      - you focus on communicating detailed organization, labeling and navigation decisions to your colleagues for the dev team
      - map out the entire site so that the dev team can implement the IA plans to the letter without requiring your involvement
      - must present the complete information hierarchy from the main page to the destination pages
      - must detail the labeling and navigation systems to be implemented in each area of the site
      -

#### administration

    - continuous evaluation and improvement of the sites IA
    - tagging new documents and weeding out old ones
    - monitoring site usage and user feedback
    - identifying opportunities to improve teh site through major/minor redesigns
    -

### major components

- navigation vs destination
  - navigation pages
    - primary purpose is to get you to the destination pages
    - e.g. main pages, search pages, and pages that help you browse a site
    - should not be included in search results
  - destination pages
    - contain the actual infomration you want

#### organization systems

- organization is closely related to navigation, labeling and indexing
  - hierarchical organization structures often play the ppart of primary navigation systems
- how you categorize information and organize content
  - aka taxonomies/hierarchies
  - present the sites information to us in a variety of ways
  - the main ways of categorizing or grouping a sites content
    - by topic
    - by task
    - by audiences
    - by chronology
- the first step in transforming data into information is exploring its organization
- all information retrieval systems work best when applied to narrow domains of homogeneous content

  - decomposing the content into narrow domains you can identify opportunities for highly effective organization systems
  -

- components

  - organization schemes
    - defines the shared characteristics of content items and influences the logical grouping of those items
    - exact/objective organization schemes
      - divide information into well-defined and mutually exclusive sections
      - requires users to know what theyre looking for
      - best for known item searching when users know exactly what they are looking for
      - easy to design and maintain because there is little intellectual work involved in assigning items to categories
      - alphabetical
        - primary organization scheme for enclyopedias and dictionaries
        - e.g.
          - alphabetical organization of a phone books white pages
          - department store directories, bookstores, libraries
        - often serve as an umbrella for other organization schemes
      - chronological
        - organized by date
        - e.g. history books, magazines, diaries, TV guides
      - geographical
        - political, social and economic issues are frequenty location-dependent
    - ambiguous/subjective organization schemes
      - divide information into categories that defy exact definition
      - users dont know what theyre looking for
      - best for browsing and associative learning when users have a vaguely defined information need
      - grouping items in intellectually meaningful ways
      - supports an associative learning process that enables users to make new connections and reach better conclusions
      - topic
        - organizing information by subject or topic is one of the most useful approaches
        - important to define the bredadth of coverage
          - e.g. all plumbers? or just plumbers in california
        - e.g. phone book yellow pages, you can look under 'plumber'
      - task
        - task-oriented schemes organize content and applications into a collection of processes, functions or tasks
        - appropriate when its possible to anticipate a limited number of high priority tasks that users will want to perform
        - common in ecommerce web sites where custerom interaction takes center stage
      - audience
        - when there are two or more clearly definavble audiences
        - works best
          - when the site is frequented by repeat visitors who can bookmark their particular section of the site
          - if there is value in customizing the content for each audience
        - open scheme
          - allow members of one audience to access the content intended for other audiences
        - closed scheme
          - prevent members from moving between audience-specific sections
          - apprirpiate if subscription fees/security issues are involved
      - metaphors
        - commonly used to help users understand the new by relating it ot he familiar
        - can help users understand the content and function of an interface intuitively
        - useful while brainstorming
        - organizational metaphors
          - leverage familiarity with one systems organization to convey quick undersanding of a new systems organization
          - e.g. a site about cars, can metaphorically be described as physical car dealership
            - new cars, users cars, repairs and services, parts and supplies, etc
        - functional metaphors
          - make a connection between the tasks you can perform in a traditional environment and those you can perform in the new environment
          - e.g. the things you can do at a library are likely the same tasks you want to do on a library web site
        - visual metaphors
          - leverage familiar graphic elements such as images, icons and colors to create a connection to the new elements
          - e.g. an online phonebook may take design elements from the yellow pages
    - hybrids
      - including elements of multiple organization schemes into a single organization scheme
  - organization structures
    - defines the types of relationships between content items and groups
    - the structure of information defines the primarhy ways in which users can navigate
    - hierarchy/taxonomy - top down approach
      - depth - number of levels in the hierarchy
      - breadth - number of options at each level of the hierarchy
      - polyhierarchical
        - taxonomies that allow cross-listing
      - best practices
        - categories should be mutual exclusive
        - balance between breadth and depth in the number of catagories
          - if a hierarchy is too narrow and deep, users have to click through an inordinate number of levels to find what they are looking for
          - too much breadth, must be sensitive to peopoles visual scanning abilities and to the cognitive limits of the human mind
          - there is general consensus that the number of links you can safely include is ocnstrained gby users abilities to visually scan the page rather than by their short term memories
          - too much depth, be even more conservative if users are forced to click through more than two/3 levels they may simply give up
          - for websites that are expected to grow
            - lean toward a broad and shallow rather than a narrow and deep hierarchy
              - allows for the addition of content without major restructuring
              - it is less problematic to add items to secondary levels of an hierarchy than to the top level of a hierarchy
                - top levels of a hierarchy serve as the mkost promiment and improtant navigation interface for users
                -
      - allows you to quickly get a handle on the scope of a website without going through an extensive content inventory process
      - begin by identifying the major content areas and exploring possible organization schemes that will provide access to that content
      - e.g.
        - family trees,
        - books (chapters, sections, paragraphs)
    - database-oriented - bottom up approach
      - metadata
        - the primary key that links information architecture to the design of database schema
        - allows you to apply structure and power of relational databases to the heterogeneous, unstructured environments of the web
      - use cases
        - automatic generation of alphabetical indexes (e.g. product index)
        - dynamic presentation of associative 'see also' links
        - fielded searching
        - advancing filtering and sorting of search results
        -
    - hypertext
      - the items/chunks of information that will be linked and the links between those chunks
      - reflect highly personal associations
      - social classification
        - aka free tagging, collaborative categorization, mob indexing, ethnoclassifcation
        - users tag objects wtih one/more keywords
        - tags are public and sere as pivots for social navigation
        - users can move fluidly between objects, authors, tags, and inexers
        - transform user behavior and tagging patterns into new organization and navigation systems
        - the ease of tagging for personal organization with social incentives leads to a rich and discoverable folksonomy
        -

- browsing aids
  - present users with a predetermined set of paths to help them navigate the site
  - users navigate your site through menus and links instead of search
- tag clouds
- metadata tagging / manual tagging
  - tool for organizing content items into groups at a very detailed level

#### labeling systems

- how you represent the categories and content created by organization systems
  - e.g. scientific terminology 'acer' or lay terminology 'maple'
- language should be meaningful to users
  - categories
  - options
  - links
- play a significant role in defining the contents of categories
- the goal of a label is to
  - communicate information efficently
    - i.e. convey meaning without taking up too muchh of a pages vertical space or a users cognitive space
  - show the users your organization and navigation system
- best practices
  - design labels that speak the same language as the sites users while reflecting its content
- types
  - contextual links
    - hyperlinks to chunks of information on other pages or to another location on the same page
    - rely upon the context in which they live
    - questions to ask
      - what kind of information will the user expewect to be taken to?
  - headings
    - describe the content that follows them
    - the hierarchical relationships between headings (parent, child, sibling) are usually established visually through consistent use of numbering, font sizes, colors and styles, whitespaces and indentation, or combinations thereof
    - using numbers is an obvious way to communicate progression, and consistently framing the labels as actions (utilizing verbs) helps tie together sequences of steps
  - navigation system choices
    - represents the ooptions in navigation systems
  - index terms
    - aka keywrods, tags, descriptive metadata, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies, thesauri, sets of index term labels
    - can be used to
      - represent content for searching or browsing
      - describe any type of content
      - provide an alternative to a sites primary organization system
  - iconic labels
    - icons represent information in much the same way text can
    - constitute a much more limited language than text
    - typically used for navigation systems or small organization system labels where the list of options is small

##### designing labels

- remember content, users and context affect all aspects of IA and designing labels specifically
- sources for labeling systems
  - your site
    - use keywords from your sites content
    - content analysis/auto extracting terms from content
  - comparable/competitive sites
  - controlled vocabularies/thesauri
  - content authors
  - user advocates
  - subject matter experts
  - search log analysis
- best practices
  - narrow scope whenever possible
    - focus your efforts on a more defined audience, you reduce the number of possible perspectives on what a label means
  - develop consistent labeling systems, not labels
    - style
    - presentation
      - fonts, sizes, colors, whitespace, grouping
    - syntax
      - verb-based - 'grooming your dog'
      - noun-based - 'diets for dogs'
    - granularity
      - labels must represent the same specificity
    - comprehensiveness
      - users can be tripped up by noticeable gaps in a labeling system
        - pants, ties, shoes... wtf happened to shirts?
    - audience
      - consider the languages of your sites major audiences
      - each audience is likley to use very different terminology
    -

#### navigation systems

- how we browse or move through information
  - e.g. clicking through a hierarchy
- help users move through the content
- effective navigation is simply the manifestation of a well-organized system
-
- types
  - global/site wide navigation systems
    - primary navigation systems that help users understand where they are and where they can go within a site
    - intended to be present on every page throughout a site
    - e.g. breadcrumbs
  - local navigation systems
    - primary navigation systems that help users understand where they are and where they can go within a portion of a site
    - complementary to global navigation systems
    - e.g. subsite
  - contextual navigation systems
    - consistently presented links to related content
    - often embedded in text
    - generally used to connect highly specialized content within a site
    - e.g. 'see also' links
  - supplemental navigation systems
    - users resort to supplemental navigation systems when global, local, or contextual navigation systems fail them
    - best practices
      - reinforce the information hierarchy so users become increasingly familiar with how the content is organized
      - facilitate fast, direct access to the contents of a site for those users who know what they want
      - avoid overwhelming hte user with too much information
    - sitemaps/tables of contents
      - navigation systems that supplement primary navigation systems
      - provide a condensed overview of and links to major content areas and subsites within the site
      - usually in outline for a site
      - e.g. breadcrums
    - site indeces
      - supplementtary navigation systems that provide an alphabetized list of links to the contents of the site
    - site guides
      - supplementary navigation systems that lead users through a sequential set of steps
      - may also link to a related subset of the sites content
      - e.g. guided tours, tutorials, micro-portals focused on a specific audience, topic or task
      - best practices
        - should be short
        - at any point hte user should be able to exit
        - navigation (prev, home, next) should be located in the same spot on every page
        - should be designed to answer specific questions
        - screenshots should be crisp clear and optimzied
        - may need a table of contents if there are many pages
    - site wizards
      - supplementary navigation systems that lead users through a sequential set of steps
      - may also link to a related subset of the sites content
  - embedded navigation systems
    - wrapped around and infused withini the content of the site
    - provde both context and flexibility
    - helps users understand where they are and where they can go
  - personalization
    - serving up tailored pages to the user based upon a model of the behavior, needs or preferences of that individual
  - social navigation
    - build on the premise that value for the individual user can be derived from observing the actions of other users
    - e.g. links to popular resources

#### search systems

- allow entry of a user-defined query and automatically present users with a customized set of results
- dynamical and mostly automated counterpart to browsing aids
- configured to index and search certain parts of the site
  - you have to discern what content to index to make it available for searching
- to display certain kinds of information in each search result
  - page title, extract, date, etc.
  - to handle searc - controlled vocabulariesh queries in certain ways
    - removing 'stop words'
      - e.g. a, the, and, of
  - 'best link' and other types of manually data that are attached to automated search results
- questions to ask
  - does your site have enough content
  - do you have the time and know how to optimize your sites search system
  - are there better alternatives
  - will your sites users bother to search
- use cases

  - when you hav etoo much ifnormation to browse
  - if you have a fragmented site
  - can be used as a learning tool
  - should be there if users expect it to be there
  - can t ame dynamism

- components

  - user query

  - search interface

    - the means of entering and revising a search query
    - all aspects of application searching come together in the interface
      - what to search
      - what to retrieve
      - how to present the results
    - things to consider
      - level of searching expertise and motivation
        - can users use specialized query languages, boolean operators, etc
        - simple/high powered interface ?
        - how many iterations are they willing to try
      - type of information need

        - how many results is the right number
      - types
        - advanced
          - where much of the search systems functionality is unveiled to users
          - be careful, as few users take advantage of advanced searching capabilities
          - have to watch the costs
        - simple 'the box' field
      - features
        - supporting revision
          - help users iteratively find better search results
          - keep the query in the search field allowing the user to modify it without reentering the entire thing
          - explain where the results came from
            - make clear what content was searched, especially if your search system supports multiple search zones
          - explain what the user did
            - especially if the results are not satisfactory, it can be useful to
              - state what happened by the scenes
              - provding the user with a better understanding the situation
              - a jumping-off point to coontinue their search

    - query language

      - the grammar of a search query
      - typically includes
        - boolean operators (AND/OR/NOT)
        - proximity operators (ADJACENT/NEAR)
        - ways of specifying which field to search (AUTHOR,NAME)

    - query builders

      - ways of enhancing a querys performance often invisible to users
      - spell checkers
        - allow users to misspell terms and still retrieve the right results by automatically correcting search terms
      - phonetic tools
        - expand a query to include 'sound-alike' terms
      - stemming tools
        - allow users to enter a term and tretrieve documents that contain varient terms with the same stem, e.g. lodge -> loding, lodger
      - natural language processing tools
        - examine the syntactic nature of a query and use that knowledge to narrow retrieval
          - e.g. is it a 'how to' question or a 'who is' question
      - controlled vocabularies/thesauri
        - expand the semantic nature of a query by automatically including synonyms within the query
      - concept searching

    - search zones
      - subsets of site content that have been separately indexed to support narrower searching (filtering)
      - each search zone should correspond to a specific need
      - pockets of more homogeneous content that act as silos for search queries
        - e.g. searching just the tech support area
      - when a user searches a search zone, they have self-identified as interested in that particular information
      - generally should match the segments of the information architecture organization scheme
        - and perhaps having an 'all' index that combines each as the default
      - basic types
        - content type
        - audience
        - role
        - subject/topic
        - geography

  - search engine

    - search algorithms
      - the part of a search engine that determines which content matches a users query
      - e.g. google pagerank
      - recall and precision
        - some algorithms return many results of varying relevance, while some return fewer higher quality results
        - recall
          - `# relevant documents retrieved / # relevant documents in collection`
          - the proportion of relevant ddocuments in the result set compared to all the relevant documents in the system
            - i.e. 'show me ALL the relevant documents'
          - high recall is generally useful for learning everything about a topic
          - e.g. in research or 'ego surfing'
        - precision
          - `# relevant documents retrieved / # total documents in collection`
          - the relevance of documents within a given result set
            - i.e. 'show me ONLY the relevant documents'
          - when it doesnt matter how mmany results exist as long as you get a good enough answer in the first few results
      - pattern-matching algorithms
        - compare the users query with an index (typically) of the full text content looking for the same string of text
      - automatic stemming
        - expands a term to include other terms that share the same root/stem
        - e.g. computer -> root = comput -> stems = computers, computation, computing, etc
        - leads to higher recall in search results

  - content

    - metadata

      - definitional data that provides information about/documentation of other data managed within an application
        - a lens through which you can view the network of relationships between IA components
      - used to describe documents, pages, images, software, and other content objects for the purposes of improved navigation and retrieval
      - each search result can be broken down into smaller atoms, e.g. authors name, which may be leveraged by a search engine, e.g. for filtering
      - representational metadata
        - quickly distinguish result types
        - e.g. title/author
      - descriptive metadata

          - term form
            - things to consider
              - grammatical form
                - use nouns for preferred terms
                - users are better at understanding and remembering nounse than verbs or adjectives
                  - however there are lots of good reasons to use verbs, especially with task-oriented words
              - spelling
                - select a specific dictionary/glossary/use your inhouse style
                - consider the most common spelling employed by your users
              - singular/plural form?
                - use the plural form of 'countable nounse', e.g. cars, roads maps
                - use the singular form for conceptual nouns, e.g. math, biology
              - abbreviations and acronyms
                - use whatever is popular
                -
        - variant term

          - indicates the reciprocal relatioship of preferred term and variant terms
          - used to show the full list of variants on the preferred terms record
        - term specificity
          - e.g. should 'knowledge management software' be represented as one, two or three terms
          - as your vocabulary grows
            - it becomes increasingly necessary to use compound terms to increase precision
        - term definition
          - often suggest multiple meanings
          - e.g. cells (biology? electric? prison?)
        - scope note
          - a specific type of definiton of the preferred term
          - used to deliberately restrict the meaning of that term to one concept in order to rule out ambiguety as much as possible
          - parenthetical term qualifiers
            - provide a way to manage homographs
          - can be used in searching/results dispplayed to assist users
      - types (Simple to complex)

        - synonym rings

          - equivalent type relatioonship between terms
          - connects a set of words that are defined as equivalent for the purposes of retrieval
          - useful in situations where different people will use different queries in search of the same thing
          - e.g. information about household products may include
            - cuisinart, cuizinart, food processor, blender, kitchen aid, etc
          - be careful
            - if the query term expansion operates behind the scenes, users can be confused by results that dont actually include their keywords
            - may result in less relevant results

        - authority files
          - equivalence + hierarhical relationship between terms
          - a synonym ring with a list of preferred terms or acceptable values
            - make sure one of the term variants are labaled as the preferred term among the variants/synonyms
            - e.g. a list of state names, and their abbreviations, and common mispellings, will all point to the preferred variant
          - used by
            - libraries and government agencies to define the proper names for a set of entities within a limited domain
            - enabling content authors and indexers to use the approved terms efficiently and ocnsistently
            - the preferred terms
              - can serve as the unique identifier for each collection of equivalent terms
              - allow for more efficient addition, deltion and modification of variant terms
              - important as the user switches from searching to browsing mode
                - when designing taxonomies, navigation bars, and indexes, aways use the preferred terms
            -
        - classification scheme
          - hierarchical + associative relationship between terms
          - aka taxonomy

          - model associative relationships between concepts (e.g. see also, see related)
            - incorporates all the relationships and capabilities of the simpler forms
          - integrated within a website to improve navigation and retrieval
            - can helpp bridge the gap between past and present
            - allow users to browse/navigate by equivalence, hierarchical and associative relationships
            - terms (preferred/variant) can be used as predefined or canned queries to be run against the full text index
          - semantic relationships
            - describe the relationship a users query terms has with other terms in the controlled vocabulary
              - preferred, variant, broader, narrower, and associative links can all return different results
              - potentially can surface these options in the search interface
            - equivalence relationship

            - hierarchical relationship
              - enables the classification of preferred terms into categories and subcategories
              - divides up the information space into cateogires and subcategories, relating broader and narrower concepts throught he familiar parent-child relationship
              - types
                - strict/pure
                  - each term appears in one and only one place
                  - e.g. a biological taxoxnomy, each species fits into one branch of the tree of life
                - polyhierarchy
                  - a term can appear in more than one place in the hierarchy, as well as be part of other compound terms

                  - e.g. california NT state
            - associative relationships
              - provides for meaningful connections that arent handled by the hierarchical or equivalence relationships
              - usually developed after youve made progress on the other two types of semantic relationships
              - defined as strongly implied semantic connections that arent captured within the equivalence or hierarchical relationships
              - e.g. hammer RT nail
              -
          - types
            - classic
              - used at the point of indexing and at the point of searching
              - indexers use the thesaurus to map v ariant terms to preferred terms when performing document level indexing
              - searchers use the thesaurus for retrieval, whether or not there awre of the role it plays in their search experience
              - query terms are matched against the rich vocabulary of the thesaurus, enabling synonym management, hierarchical browsering and associative linking
              - this is the full bodied, fully integrated thesaurus your usee to
            - indexing
              - able to perform controlled vocabulary indexing
                - but not able to work at the point of searching and mapping users variant terms to preferred terms
              - structures the indexing process
                - promoting consistency and efficiency
              - build browsable indexes of preferred terms,
                - enabling users to find all documents about a paritcular subject or product through a single point of access
              - useful for captive audiences (e.g. no where else to go)
                - users can be expected to learn the preferred terms over time
            - searching
              - leverages a controlled vocabulary at the poiint of searching
                - but not at the point of indexing
              - maps users search query terms to the controlled vocabulary before executing the query against the full text index
              - perform equivalence term explosion
              - posting down
                - explode down the hierarchy to include all narrower terms

    - involves decisions of
      - what types of content that should make up each individual result
        - display less information
          - to users who know what theyre looking for
        - display more information
          - to users who arent sure what they want
          - its hard to distinguish results because of commonly displayed fields (e.g. 10 results by the same author)
      - how many results to display
        - many users will not venture past the first screen
        - if the search engine is configured to display a lot of infromation for each retrieved document
          - consider having a smaller retrieval set to improve performance
        - always inform the user of how many results were retrieved, and which set they are viewing
      - how sets of results should be ranked, sorted and clustered
        - depends on
          - the kind of information needs the user starts with
          - what type of results they are hoping to receive
          - how they plan to use the results
        - sorted e.g. chronologically by date, alphabetically,
          - useful for users seeking to make a decision/take an action
        - ranked e.g. by relevance/popularity
          - by relevance
            - how many of the querys terms occur in the document
            - how frequently query terms occur in the document
            - how close together query terms occur, e.g. adjacent, same sentence, paragraph
            - where query terms occur, e.g. title, body
            - the popularity of the document where the query terms appear
              - e.g. is it linked frequently, and are the sources of its links themselves popular
          - by popularity
            - rank results by which ones are the most popular
            - works best with large multisite environnments with many users

      - use cases
        - there is a need to understand information or learn something
        - describe retrieved docouments relevance, e.g. most -> least
    - presenting 'similar' results for an existing search result
      - document simularity
        - when you already have a good search result on hand, converting it into the equivalent of a search query
        - process
          - `stop words` are removed out of the document, leaving a useful set of semantically rich terms that idealy represent the document
          - the remaining terms are converted into a query that should retrieve similar results to the containing document
      - present results that have been indexed with similar metadata
      - cited by
        - display other results that cite the current one
        - the relationship between cited and citing papers implies some degree of mutual relevance
      - active bibliography (related documents)
        - this paper cites others in its own bibliography implying a similar type of shared relevance
      - similar documents based on text
        - documents are converted into queries automatically and are used to find similar documents
      - related documents from co-citation
        - if documents appear together in the bibliographies of other papers, they probably have something in common

#### content and tasks

- the users ultimate destinations, as opposed to separate components that get users to their desitinations
- headings
  - labels for the content that follows them
- embedded links
  - links within text, these label (i.e. represent) the content they link to
- embedded metadata
  - information that can be used as metadata but must first be extracted
  - e.g. in a recipe, the ingredients can be indexed to support searching by ingredient
- chunks
  - logical units of content
  - can vary in granularity
    - e.g. sectinos and chapters are both chunks
  - can be nested
    - e.g. section is part of a book
- lists
  - groups of chunks or links to chunks
  - are important because
    - theyve been grouped together (share some trait in common)
    - have been presented in a particular order (e.g. chronologically)
- sequential aids
  - clues that suggest
    - where the user is in a process or task
    - how far he has to go before completing it
- identifiers
  - clues that suggest where the user is in an information system
  - e.g.
    - logo specifying what site she is using
    - breadcrumb explaining where in the site she is

#### invisible components

- certain key architectural components are manifest completely in the background
- users rarely (if ever) interact with them
- often 'feed' other components

  - e.g. a thesaurus used to enhance a search query

- controlled vocabularies

  - predetermined vocabularies of preferred terms that describe a specific domain
    - e.g. auto racing/orthopedic surgery
  - supporting tools
    - metadata matrixes
      - facilitate discussion about the prioritization of vocabularies
    - any applicaation that enables you to manage the vocabulary terms and relationships
  - typically include variant terms
    - e.g. 'brewskie' for 'beer'
  - thesauri
    - controlled vocabularies that generally include linkis to browser and narrower terms, related terms and descriptions of preferred terms (aka scope notes)

- retrieval algorithms
  - used to rank search results by relevance
  - reflect their pgrogrammers judgments on how to determine relevance
- best bets

  - preferred search results that are manually coupled with a search query
  - editors and subject matter experts determine
    - queries should retrieve best bets
    - which documents merit best bet status
