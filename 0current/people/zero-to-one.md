# TLDR

zero to one
notes on startups, or how to build the future
peter thiel with blake masters

## preface

- every moment in business happens only once
- its easier to copy a model than to make something new
  - doing what we already know takes the worl from 1 to n
  - creating something new takes the world from 0 to 1
- unless they invest int he difficult takst of creating new things, companies will fail in the future now matter how big their profits remain today
- todays best practices lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried
- humans are distinguished from other speciies by our ability to work myricals
  - these miracles are called technology
- technology allows us to do more with less: racheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level
- by creating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of hte world
- you should build companies that create new things
- the paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily cannot xist
  - because every innovation is ne and unique, and no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative
- the most powerful pattern is that successful people find value in unexpected places
  - and thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas

## chapter 1: the challenge of the future

- what important truth do very few people agree with you on?
  - correct response: most people believe in X, but the truth is the oppositve of X
- brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius
- the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come
  - it will be a time when the world looks different from today
  - if nothing changes about society for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100 years away
  - if something radically changes in th next decage, then the future is nearly at hand
- no one can predict the future, but two things must be true
  - its going to be different
  - and it must be roote din todays' world
- when we think about the future, we should hope for a future of progress
  - horizontal/extensive progress: copying things that work: going from 1 to N
    - easy to imagine:
    - e.g. take one typewriter and build another 100 better typwriters
    - globalization: the single word for horizontal progress
      - e.g. china rising from the depths by copying (and leapfrogging) the working solutions implemented by other nations
        - china's 20 year plan is to become what the USA is today
  - vertical/intensive progress: doin new things: going from 0 to 1
    - harder to image because it requires doing something nobody else has ever done
      - e.g. go from a typewriter to a word processor
    - technology: the single word for vertical progress
      - any new and better way of doings can be considered `technology`
- age of globalization
  - easy to imagine that the future will bring more convergence and more sameness
  - i.e. a kind of technological end of history: the division of the world into socalled devleoped and developing nations as if the world has already achieved the achievable
  - remember globalization and technology are opposing forces, two ends of a spectrum
    - globalization means spreading existing ideas
      - spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devestation, not riches
    - technology measn inventing new ones
      - without technology, globalization is unsustainable
      - our challenge today is to  both imagine and create the new technologies that can make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous than the 20th
- smartphone
  - the smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroundings are strangely old
    - only computers and communications ave improved dramatically since midcentury
- startups, technology, big organizations
  - new technology tends to come from new veutures, i.e. startups
    - small groups of people bound together by a sense of missoin are the ones who change the world for the better
    - the largest gorup of peopl eyou can convince of a plan to buil a different future
    small size affords spac eto think
    - startups must question received and rethink business from scratch
  - big organizations
    - its hard to develop new things in big orgnaizations;
    - its even harder to
  - a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future
    - a new company's most important strength is new thinking; even more important than nimblness
    - small size affords space to think
    - understand what questions you must ask and answer to succeed in the business of doing new things
      - that is what a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch
- if you can identify a delusional popular belief,e yo can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth
  - conventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect
  - whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bublbe
- the first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past
- every week, dozens of new startups competed to throw the most lavish launch party
  - landing parties were much more rare
  - the most successful companies seemed to embrace a sort of ant-business model where they lost money as they grew
- for paypal to work
  - needed to attract a critical mass of atleast a million users
    - advertising was too ineffective; banks kept falling through
    - they decided to pay people to sign up and take a cut on every transaction
      - however this customer acquisition strategy was unsustainable on its own
        - whe you pay people to be your customers, expenonential growth means an exponentially growing cost structure
- globalization replaced technology as the hope for the future
  - entrepreneurs  who stuck with silicon valley learned four big lessons from the dot com crash that still guide busines sthinking today
    - make incremental advances
      - grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. anyone who claims to be able to do soemthing great is suspect and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble
      - small incremental steps are the only safe path forward
    - stay lean and flexible
      - all companies must be lean, which is code for unplanned
      - you should not know what your business will do
      - planning is arragant and inflexible
      - instead you should try things out, iterate and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation
    - improve on the competition
      - dont try to create a new market prematurely
      - the only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing custom
      - you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors
    - focus on product, not sales
      - if your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell its not good neough
      - technology is primarly about product devleopment, not distribution
      - bubble era advertising was obviously wasteful; so the only sustainable growth is viral growth
  - the aforementioned lessons have become dogma in the startup world
    - the opposite principles are probably more correct
      - it is better to risk boldness than triviality
      - a bad plan is better htan no plan
      - competitive markets destroy profits
      - sales matters just as much as product
- the late 90s
  - people believed in going from 0 to 1
  - too few startups were actually getting there, and many never went beyond talking about it
  - it was also a peak of clarity
    - people looked far into the future, and saw how much valueable new technology we would need to get there safely
      - and JUDGED themselves capapble of creating it
- to build the next genreation of companies
  - we must abandon the dogmas created after the dot com creash
  - ask yourself
    - how much of what you know abou business is shapred by mistaken reacts to past mistakes
    - the most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself

## chapter 2: party like its 1999

- if you can identify a delusional popular belief; you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth
  - conventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary, and wrong in retrospect
  - whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble
- the first step to thinking clealry is to question what we think we know about the past
- foolery before the dot com crash & burn
  - every week: doezens of new startups compete to throw the most lavish launch party
    - but landing parties are more rare
  - the most `successful` companies seemed to embrace a sort of anti-business model where they lost money as they grew
