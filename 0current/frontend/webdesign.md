# web design

- general thoughts from my experience, which starts and ends with always paying for a good designer

## thoughts

- always start with the information architecture (theres a file or that somewhere)
- always start with high quality copy, then define the structure, then define the styles
- always start with the medium, the devices, the platform serving your poop
