OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default:

    HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
    Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn’t available).
    Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
    Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.
