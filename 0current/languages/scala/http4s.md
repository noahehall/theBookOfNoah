# http4s

- Http4s is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s is Scala's answer to Ruby's Rack, Python's WSGI, Haskell's WAI, and Java's Servlets.
- http4s cross-builds for Scala.js, enabling you to share code across browsers, Node.js apps, serverless functions, and JVM servers.
