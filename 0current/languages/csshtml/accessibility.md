## terms

- assistive technologies: umbrella term that helps users complete some task
  - browser zoom, braile display, voice control, screen readers, etc

  - provide important functionality to support assistive technologies
    - retrieving web content from program objects
    - parsing markup into identifiable bundles
- [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-assistive-technologies):
  - target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities
  - hardware/software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

  - visual location
  - orientation
  - sound

### best practices

- [apply name, role and value to all user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value)
- always provide descriptive identifications of content that cannot be made accessible in a meaningful way
- think: what purpose is this serving, and how do I serve this purpose in another form
  - i.e. what is the purpose of this user interface item: how is this purpose fulfilled for people who cant read/see/perceive colors/ hear/ etc.
- questions to ask when crafting accessible content
  - what is the information component or user interface component
    - is it text-content or non-text content
  - what is its purpose
  - what is the situation
  - what are the alternative techniques for success in this situation
- use a button instead of a link when
  - the link is empty/has no `href` attribute
  - the link has an `onclick` handler
- dont add redundant aria `landmark` roles to html5 semantic elements
  - `role='banner'` === `<header>`
  - `role='complementary'` === `<aside>`
  - `role='contentinfo'` === `<footer>`
  - `role='form'` === `<form>`
  - `role='main`' === `<main>`
  - `role='navigation'` === `<nav>`
  - `role='region'` === `<section>`
- everyone can access the site's content and use it's functionality
  - for users who are experiencing some time of impairment
  - the sites' content should be available to everyone
  - the sites' functionality can be operated by anyone
- think about users
  - visually impaired (color, near sited, far sited, braile)
    - use braile readers, text to speach, magnification (zoomed in), keyboard navigation, color contrast plugins
  - hearing impaired
  - motor
    - use hand/eye tracking software, voice dictation
  - cognitive (understanding, memory, etc) issues
  - Impairments can be:
    1. permanent
    2. temporary
    3. situational
- think through end-user user environments
  - desktop
  - mobile
  - screen readers
  - tablets
- (WCAG): [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
  - [AIM Checklist](http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)
  - POUR Guidelines
    1. Perceivable: users can perceive content
    2. Operable: users can navigate
    3. Understandable: users can understand the content and interface and avoid confusion
    4. Robust: can a wide variety of agents consume the data
- functionality
  - keyboard navigation
  - shortcut keys
- Style and visual design:
  - text color should be high contrast with background color for readability (sight)
  - should be minimal to help with understanding the page
  - check your design patterns against aria: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/
- Forms:
  - Inputs and labels should be close enough together for understanding the relation between the two
    - if they are two far apart, you cant zoom in and see the relation (site)
  - labels should activate inputs
- Audio
  - audio should be accompanied with visual actions
- [Managing focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management)
  - focus: the control on the screen that receives input from the keyboard and clipboard when you paste/type
    - determines where keyboard events go
    - not all elements are focusble by default, and will not be included in the tab order
- Managing shortcuts:
  - implement the following:
    - some environemnts enforce all keyboard commands to also use command (e.g. on mac)
    - tab order: move through focusable (i.e. interactive elements, e.g. input, select, button) and not content elements (e.g. div )
      - elements are inserted into the tab order based on their position in the DOM
      - using css tabIndex to control the tab order
        - try to always use the natural tab order
      - an exception to adding tab order to non-interactive elements is when you're managing focus:
        1. reloading parts of a page without a full page refresh, and need to indicate to user what has changed
        2. in page navigation, e.g. through #anchor links and need to inform user
    1. tab: move forward
    2. shift tab: move backward
    3. arrow keys: move within a component
    4. spacebar: select/deselect
  - skip links: allows keyboard users to skip to main content
    - `<a href='#your-main-content-id' class='skip-link'> skip to main content </a>`
      - this element should be position off screen when not focused (e.g. left: -40px;), and positioned on screen (E.g. top left corner) when focused
    - your main content should have a parent elementwith the corrosponding id
      - make sure to add tabindex='-1'
  - roving focus: perfect for radio buttons, so that keyboarding through items in the radio will loop through from beginning to end
    - set the currently checked item to tabindex=0, and all other buttons inthe group to tabindex='-1' via an event listener
  - manage offscreen / hidden content that receives focus but does not appear on screen
    - you can log window.activeElement to get the exact element that is currently focused
    - check the chrome dev tools accessibilty audit chrome plugins
    - best practices:
      1. set visibility: hidden, display: none for offscreen/hidden items so they cannot receive focus, then do the opposite when they are to be visible/on screen
  - manage keyboard/modal traps
    - when you click into a (e.g a select element) in a modal, you may be unable to tab out of it, as the tab shortcut is trying to finish your autocomplete info
    - or when you are on a modal, and the modal is open but the user tabs out of the modal and returns to the main page but the modal is still open so the page looks disabled
      - keep track of the element that had focus before the modal was opened
      - trap the focus inside the modal until closes
        - this is done by listening for tab & shit.tab events and programmatically calling focus() to elements you allow
      - return focus to the previous element
- Touch points:
  1. DOM order
  2. Managing focus
  3. Managing navigation via tabindex
  4. Keyboard shortcuts
  5. Semantics
  6. Labeling inputs
  7. Headings in sections
  8. Landmarks (html structural elements)
  9. Links
  10. ARIA roles and design patterns
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/
  11. Ensuring only appropriate sections of a document are exposed to assistive technologies, or hidden from non-assistive technologies
  12. ensuring LIVE regions (i.e. updates) are communicated to users
  13. managing the styles and using aria-attributes instead of classes
  14. ensuring you have a responsive design for multiple devices
  15. breakdown existing acciessibility issues based on:
  16. is this a critical piece of the app functinoality?
  17. how frequently is this piece of UI/UX used?
  18. do we need to fix this?
  19. all of the above should ensure the ACCESSIBILITY TREE is as it should be
- Focus
  - Styles: :focus, :hover, :before,
  - properties: outline, box-shadow
    radio:focus::before { some styles }
- Design
  - always use <meta name=viewport
  - always use responsive grid
- Fonts:
  - use relative units as much as possible (e.g. em, rem)
- Touches:
  - at least 48dp minimum touch size per touch target (average size of a finger)
  - at least 32dp minimum margin around touch targets (so you dont accidently touch another thing)
- color and contrast:
  - contrast ratio: body text and images have a high contrast with background color
    - http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
  - dont convey info with color and contrast alone, always provide additional help text
- forms: HTML Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application.
  1. should have progress meter
  2. should be quick to finish
  3. validation messages should be clear and located next to their errors
  4. inputs should have placeholders
  5. inputs should autocomplete based on users known data
  6. always realtime validation

### gotchas

- dont confuse `button` with `a.role='button'`
  - links activated via `enter` and `return`
  - buttons activated via `spacebar`
  - `role='button'` do not add `spacebar` listeners to its element

### Accessbility Semantics

#### Programmatically Expressed Semantics

- Semantics: the elements, and its attributes, is used in a way facitilitates its meanings programmaticaly to describe its functionality
  - for all user interface components:
    - the name and role can be programmatically determined
    - states, properties, and values can be programmatically set
  - screen readers convert a visual page into auditory sounds that users can enter information into
- Attributes:
  - Role: what type of element it is
    - e.g. 'Edit Text'
  - Name (i.e. label text or text alternative): if it has one
    - Text Alternatives: for elements that do not have labels, e.g. images, buttons, etc.
      - the text associated with these (e.g. in the alt= or as a text node) because its name/label
      - imagine all your images are broken, and think of what you would need in the alt= to understand what the image should be
  - Value: if it has one
  - State: if it has any
- The Accessibility tree: screen readers take the DOM and strip away its visible elements, to create an accessibility tree based on the programmatic semantics of the html elements
  - its all based on role, name, value, and state
- Navigating Content: links, form controls, headings, and landmarks
  - Link Text: should be descriptive, not just 'click here', but the text should tell you exactly where it go
    - all links should have an href
    - the href= should never be href=#
    - anchors with child images: the image must have an alt text
  - Landmarks: describe areas of a page, versus a single element
    - main: only one per page
    - header: page banner or grouping element for introductory content for a section
    - footer: a page footer or grouping element for a section of a page
    - nav: a section of a page that links to other pages, or parts within a page
    - article: self contained sections of content, e.g. blog entry, forum posts, etc.
      - will the ocntent make sense in a another context?
    - section: generic section of a document or application
      - should contain a heading
    - aside: tangentialy related to the content around it
  - Headings: are the best thing to implement for screen readers
    - HEading order: follows the DOM Order and not the visual order of the page
      - get dom order of headings:
        ```
          for (var i = 0, headings = $$('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6');
               i < headings.length; i++) {
             console.log(headings[i].textContent.trim() + " " +
                         headings[i].tagName,
                         headings[i]);
          }
        ```
      - you can include headings off screen to help with screen readers, but do not go overboard
        - i.e. headings absolutely positioned off screen

### ARIA

- ARIA: accessible rich internet applications; set of attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities
  - web accessibility issues cannot be managed with native HTML, ARIA bridges the gap between HTML and assistive technologies
- main concepts and brief examples
  - `roles`: used to define a typ eof user interface element, e.g. `role=ROLE_NAME`
    - `abstract roles`: utilized by user agents (e.g. browsers) and should not be used in code
      - give `roles` their meanings behind the scenes
    - `document structure roles`: arent normally interactive, but isntead provide descriptions for sections wihtin a page
      - e.g. `role='img|document|heading|list|listitem|toolbar'`
      - used to identify ontent while navigating a page
      - provides context of the context their viewing
      - the most robust choice is to use `document structure roles` and `html5 semantic elements` together
    - `landmark roles`: for easier navigation, identify eachh section of content within a page
      - e.g. `role='banner|contentinfo|form|main|navigation|search'`
      - assistive technologies will announce the start and end of each landmark role set on a page and display list of these roles/regions (e.g. screen readers do this)
    - widget roles: add semantic meaning to elements and user interfaces
      - e.g. standalone widgets `role='alert|button|checkbox|link|menuitem|tab|tabpanel`
      - e.g. composite widgets `role='combobox|grid|listbox|menu|radiogroup|tablist`
      - widge roles are for elements users interact with to get things done
        - e.g. completing forms, open/closing tabs/panels, navigating a main/sidebar menu
  - states and properties
    - used together to suppor ARIA roles existing on a page
    - `states` change based on user interaction or state of UI components via JS event handlers
      - e.g. `checkbox[aria-checked|disabled]`
    - `properties` rarely changed once set
      - e.g. `div[class='fakeinput'][aria-labelledby|describedby]`
    - common states and props
      - `aria-describedby|haspopup|hidden|label|labeledby`
    - drag-and-drop attributes
      - conveyes information to assistive technologies about drag-and-drop elements, including draggable elmenets and their drop targets
      - e.g. `aria-dropeffect|grabbed`
    - live region attributes
      - indicates changes in content for a users assistive technology,
      - these elements dont need to have focus and can include infomration on how the user should proceed
        - e.g. whether a message will be read aloud with the flow of content (`aria-alive='polite'`)
        - e.g. wheter a message will inerrupt the flow of ocntent and be read aloud immediately (`aria-live='assertive'`)
        - e.g. `aria-atomic|busy|live`
    - relationship attributes
      - add relationships between elements that cant be determined otherwise
      - for understanding how informatin is related when nevaginat the page and gathering additional data from various elements like forms, menus, tabs/panels
      - e.g. `aria-describedby|labeledby`
    - widget attributes
      - for common UI elements that receive input from users while processing those actions and information
      - for avoiding confusion and easily utilizing interactive UI elements like forms, overlays/modals/popups
      - e.g. `aria-autocomplete|checked|disabled|label|required`
- rules of aria
  - rule 1
    - dont use aria if there a native HTML element already provides the accessibility support
      - [check the html element here](https://www.html5accessibility.com/)
    - exceptions
      - the design doenst allow for a specific native element because of limitations on styling
      - the desired accessibility feature isnt uspported by native html
        - [check the accessibility feature status here](https://www.tpgi.com/aria-in-html-there-goes-the-neighborhood/#html5na)
  - rule 2
    - do not change the native HTML semantics unless you absolutely have to
      - ARIA does not get added to the DOM immediately
        - so first get the DOM semantically correct, then add ARIA
        - e.g. instead of `span.role=button` just use a friggin `button`
  - rule 3 `tab order` `tabindex`
    - all interactive ARIA controls must be keyboard accessible
      - add `tabindex='0'` to force them into the logical `tab order` and able to receive keyboard focus
  - rule 4
    - never add `role='presentation'` or `aria-hidden='true'` to a focusable element
      - this will cause them to lose focasibility and be removed from the logical tab order
  - rule 5
    - give all interactive elements an accessible name
      - i.e. apply an label element or `aria-label` attribute to all interactive elements (e.g. inputs)
- common aria use-cases
  - semantics
    - use appropriate html5 and then aria roles & attributes to provide effective semantic meaning to content
  - descriptive labels
    - whenever you need to provide additional context to HTML elements like buttons or links
      - `aria-label='your extended description'`
  - alerts
    - inform assistive technologies of important events in response to user interactions or application life cycles by adding aria `live regions` and `alert messages` to HTML elements
      - `<div class='alert-message' role='alert'>something happened!</div>`
      - `aria-live=assert`
  - relationships
    - use aria attributes on elements who are related
      - e.g. `aria-controls=someid.id=controllerid` && `someelement.id=someid.aria-labeledby=controllerid`
  - forms
    - structure
      - organized related sections of a form into fieldsets
    - labeling
      - add aria attributes to form elements to support screen readers and other assistive technologies
    - events
      - use inline form errors that appear next to form control that causes the error
        - e.g. `aria-required` for controls and `aria-autocomplete`
  - `tab order` `tabindex`
    - some elements must automaically receive keyboard focus
      - `skip to main content` links
      - ...TODO
    - some application states require specific `tab order` restraints
      - when a modal/popup/etc is open tab order should be constrained to elements within the component and not be permitted on lower dimensions
        - set `tabindex=-1` on those elements, and use a third-party module to trap focus within the open widget component
  - color contrast & intensity
  - navigation
    - skip navigation
  - image handling
  - text resize
  - search form and presentation
  - drag and drop
  - html5 vs aria
    - remove duplicate tags
    - remove null tags

#### ARIA Semantics

- ARIA is used to express semantics that native html elements cannot express on its own

* https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/
* modifies how elements are translated into the accessibility tree via custom attributes
  - great when you need to use a div (instead of a checkbox) but still need that div to show up as a checkbox to assistive technologies
* ARIAs only purpose is to modify the accessibility tree, it does not:
  - modify element appearance
  - modify element behavior
  - add focusability
  - add keyboard handling
    - all of the above must be handled by javascript ;)
* ARIA breakdown:
  - role: the semantic meaning of the element
    - includes superclass, subclass, and related concepts (roles) that have similar, but not identical semantics
  - inherited states/properties: attributes that can be used with the given role, some are requied, others are optional
  - Name from: where the name (label) will be retrieved from, e.g.
    - the text content
    - or the html author
  - important attributes:
    - name:
      - aria-label: screen reader only name
      - aria-labelledby=id: specify another element that provides the name for this element
      - aria-describedby=id: additional text describing this element is provided by some other element
    - ARIA landmark roles: banner, navigation, main, complementary, search, dialog, contentinfo
    - relationships:
      - aria-owns="id1 id2 id3 idX" specify this element owns the other element(S), and should be listed as the parent of them all in the accessibility tree
        - this modifies the hierarchy of the accessibility tree
      - aria-activedescendant='idX': when the parent has focus, this element should actually be the one given focus
        - this way the parent can keep actual focus and receive keyboard events, while the idX is updated to the element that should be visually given focus
      - aria-describedby: extra explanatary text that a user may need
      - aria-posinset: 1-based position in set, e.g. x out of y. used with aria-setsize
      - aria-setsize: relationship between sibling elements in a set, used with aria-posinset
        - perfect for lazy loading, to specify the total number of items in a set, even when some of the items have not been loaded yet
      - aria-hidden: hide elements from assistive technologies
      - aria-live=off|polite|assertive: specify that updates should be communicated to users as soon as it hits the DOM
        - e.g. status updates
        - polite: alert when no other alerts are happening
        - assertive: interrupt and alert immediately
        - aria-live region should be in the initial page load
        - set it on the parent most element
        - related attributes:
          - aria-atomic: whether the entire region should be communicated to the user
          - aria-relevant=additions|removals|text|all: what should be communicated to the user
    - states
      - aria-pressed: indicated if the state of this button/interactive element is pressed|clicked
      - aria-hidden: element is hidden
      - aria-expanded: element is open

### WCAG

- WCAG: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
  - defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities
    - visual:
    - auditory:
    - physical:
    - speech:
    - cognitive:
    - language:
    - learning:
    - neurological:
- WCAG versions
  - each version _builds on_ and _meets_ the guidelines set by the previous version
  - thus 2.2 meets and expands on 2.1, which does the same for 2.0, etc
- WCAG guidance dimensions: 4 principles provide the foundation for web accessibility
  - perceivable: information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
    - text alternatives: for any non-text content to be perceivable by users in other forms
      - common (sensory perception) forms:
        - print
        - braille
        - speech
        - symbols
        - simpler language
      - content types (potentially) not available in other forms and how to adapt them
        - controls/input: [must have a name attribute to describe its purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name)
        - [time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#time-based-media): at least provide descriptive identification of the content
        - test or exercise: if unable to provide a text alternative, at least provide a descriptive identificatoin of the non-text content
        - [sensory experiences](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-specific-sensory-experience): text alternatives provide descriptive identification of the non-text content
        - CAPTCHA: if the purpose it so confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer (i.e. a normal fkn captcha), text alternatives should identify and describe the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of captcha using different types of sensory perception are provided to accomodate different disabilities
        - Decoration, formatting, invisible: if non-text content is pure decoration, used only for visual formatting/not presented t users. then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology
  - operable:
  - understandable:
  - robust: 2. guidelines: 13 guidelines provide the basic goals in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities 3. success criteria: for each of the 13 guidelines, exist _testable success criteria_ for _requirements_ and _conformance_ **testing** - design specification - purchasing - regulation - contractual agreements - conformance levels: rough thresholds to assess how well web content meet the success levels - A: lowest success - AA: medium success - AAA: the gold standard! 4. sufficient and advisory techniques: for each _guideline_ and _success criteria_ a number of techniques are documented. - techniques sufficient for _meeting_ success crtieria - techniques sufficient for _meeting_ and **go beyond** (these are _advisory techniques_)
