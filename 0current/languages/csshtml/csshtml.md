# CSS + HTML

- not everything is captured, dont depend on this file as a full reference
  - e.g. some tricks arent listed based on my opinions
  - check MDN, then w3.org as your use case becomes more complex
- mainly for keeping me up to date whenever I return to a predominately frontend role

  - where expert level css knowledge is required to remain efficient

- note about anything design related: im not a designer, not interested in being a designer, but all frontend devs needs to have some basic knowledge in case we need to push back against something crazy that doesnt make sense
  - designers are special people, like a good painter/basketball player, your born with a 6th sense,

## basics

### best practices / gotchas

- putting inline elements on different lines in source code creates a space between them

  - set fontsize 0 to the containing element

- always validate your CSS, e.g. with <http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input>
- always size things from the inside out
- use `background-clip` to adjust how background-color|image fill its element
- set the opacity of selected elements and their children via `opacity`
- `@import` statements must precede all other types of rules except charset and cannot be ussed inside conditional group at-rule
  - in general, review the `import` link above as there are many gotchas
- review `@font-face` syntax before using them, too many gotchas
- set the page font size on the body element, and size everything relative to that via rem, or is em?
- always declar a `:root {}` selector set your variables, 9 times out of 8 you should be using variables mutherfucker
- GRID vs FLEXBOX vs WTF
  - ROW | COLUMN - flexbox
  - ROW & COLUMN - grid
  - CONTENT-OUT (content forces layout) - flexbox
    - e.g. when placing items evenly in a container, let the size of the content decide how much individual space each item takes
      - you can still use grid, but then the grid items will change the entire track
  - LAYOUT-IN (layout forces content) - grid
    - e.g. when placing items evenly in a container, you let the available space of the layout determine how the items are placed
  - BOX ALIGNMENT - flexbox
    - aligning items within a box,
- use the picture element to offer alternative versions of an image for different displays/devices
  - combine with at-rules
- the `content:` rule is powerful, use it whenver you need to insert dynamic content via css and not js
  - is generally used with
    - selector::before|after to target the anchor element for the content to be inserted
    - attr(data-prop) to retrieve the value of the HTML DATA property and insert it as content
- think creatively when using `calc` and custom properties
  - e.g. read [this link](https://oky.dk/blog/1kb-grid)

### terms

- CSS Preprocessor: scripting language that extends CSS and then compiltes it into regular CSS
- w3 explanation of colors & status codes
  - shouldnt use
    - FPWD: first public working draft
    - WD: working draft
  - could use
    - CR: candidate recommendation
    - CRD: candidate recommendation draft
  - ready for enterprise
    - PR: proposed recommendation
    - REC: recommendation
  - theres a better version out
    - SPSD: superseded recommendation:

## design

### designing a website

- from webflow
  - goal identification
    - purpose of the site
    - primary purpose to inform ? sell ? etcs
    - who is the site for
    - what do they expect to find/do
    - competitors and their sites
    - tools: audience personas, creative brief, competitor anlaysis, brand attributes
  - scope definition
    - what web pages and features the site requires to fullfil the goal
    - timeline
    - tools: gantt charts, design contract
  - sitemap and wireframe creation
    - how the content and features in the scope will interrelate and their hierarchy/relationship
    - wireframe:
    - tools: webflow, all the other shit costs, fuck them
  - content creation
    - creating content for individual pages
    - tools:
      - content creation: google docs, dropbox paper, quip, gather content,
      - seo: google keyword planner, google trends, screaming frogs seo spider
  - visual elements
    - developing the visual brand
    - tools
      - style tyles, moodboards, element collages
      -
  - testing
    - fuck your tests bitch

### picking a color pallete

- some guys process (Css tricks)
  - determine the mood of your site to guide the development of a color pallete
  - find your main color
  - add 2/3 supporting colors
    - add additional supporting colors as needed
    - changing the tint (mixing with white) and shade (mixing with black)
- some other guy
  - start with greyscale
    - ensures a focus on useability and clear navigation rather than assigning colors to elements
    - focus on
      - layout out elements
      - optimiznig white space
      - creating a hierarchy of type and elements
  - develop a 60-30-10 % rule
    - comes from interior design when assigning colors to things
      - a color pallete should have no momre than 5 colors cuz some muthafucka from invionapp wrote a blog post
    - 60% to your dominant hue
    - 30% to secondary color
    - 10% for accent color
  - the best color combinations come from nature
    - because they will always look natural
    - e.g. sunrise, sunsets, beach scenes, etc

### type

- set font-size to vw (viewport width) so it scales with the viewport
- use repetitive styles across similar elements
- use hierarchy wisely
  - the distinction between differnet fonts, colors, size, capitalization etc
- choosing a font
  - a balance between readbility and IMPACT
    - the length of text can help decide between the two
- set the line-height larger than the font size to reduce cramping
  - dont set a unit to your line-height value, as a unitless line-height is proportional to its font-size!

### layout

- layout movement:
  - how the content flows and your eyes move through the flow of the page
  - direct a users eye in order to tell a sotry, CTAs, or encourage scrolling/navigation
- layout proximity:
  - establishes relationships between objects
  - use repetition (Based on fontsize) to establish a spacing-schema
    - 0.25rem, .5rem, 1rem, 2rem, 4rem

### color

- conveys personality and calls attention
- gives pages life and emotion
- saturation (color intensity)
  - the strength/weakness of a color
- brightness|value (how close to white or black)
  - darker moods = darker colors
- hue (color, like blue or red)
  - the hue of a color is what gives it meaning
  - most people associate hues with ideas (see link)
- chroma (how pure a color is)
  - lack of whitie, black or gray added to it
- tone
  - creaated by adding gray toa pure hue
- shade
  - created by adding black to a pure hue
- tint
  - created by adding white to a hue
- types of color palettes (theres many more)
  - monochromatic
    - different shades and depths of aa single hue
    - i.e. there there all the same color
    - can be very boring
  - analogous
    - a main color and the colors from either side of it on the color wheel
    - do a great job of
      - expressing consistency and uniformity within design
      - limiting any distraction away from the content
    - isnt a large differentiation in hue
    - contrast is struck primarily through the variations in color shade
  - complementary
    - i.e. opposite colors from the color wheel
      - red and green
        blue and orange
    - great for
      - communicating a sense of balance
    - add tints & shades to expand the color pallete
      - helps to avoid the glaring contrasts (causes eyestrain) when two opposing colors are placed next to each other
  - triadic
    - three colors from equidistant points ont he color whweel
      - e.g. red, yellow and blue
    - creates a diverse color pallete
    - requires a lot of planning and experimentation
- color meanings
  - red
    - energy, power, passion
  - orange
    - join, enthusiasm, creativity
  - yellow
    - happiness, intellect, energy
  - green
    - ambition, growth, freshness, safety
  - blue
    - tranquility, confidence, intelligence
  - purple
    - luxury, ambition, creativity
  - black
    - power, elegance, mystery
  - white
    - cleanliness, purity, perfection
- ensure your theres enough contrast between foreground and background colors
  - the difference in saturation, brightness and hue
  - important for accessibility for those with low vision/color blindness

### design toolbelt

#### CSS features

- blend modes
  - how content (e.g. images) blends with the background and foreground
  - background-blend-mode
    - setting the Container Background-Blend-Mode: Darken on background-image and background-color to get a colorizing effect. You can also create an overlay with pseudo-elements (i.e. :before and :after) on the image wrapper to get the same effect.
  - mix-blend mode
    - blend in the contents of the element with the contents of its direct parent background. One use of this mode is overlapped lettering instead of adjusting the opacity, which often results in loss of color vividness
- masking
  - tell the browser which elements to show/hide via Raster elements, CSS gradients and SVG elements are three ways masking can be done
- clipping
  - the shape's boundary and defining areas of the image that shall be visible
- text container shapes
  - how text flows around its container, e.g. on the outside circle
    - shape-outside
    - shape-inside
      - both use shapes circle(), polygon(), inset() or ellipse().
- transform and skew
  - use to adjust perspective
- animations
- initial letter
  - selects the first letter of an element and specifies the number of lines it occupies (above or below the initial line)
- variable fonts
  - set of features defined in the OpenType specification
  - enables font files to contain multiple variations of a font in a single file
    - you can then pick which variation via CSS and use variables to adjust them
    - ital: italic
    - wght: the fonts weight
    - wdth: the fonts width
    - opsz: adjust the optical size of the font
    - slnt - the slant of the font
- logical properties and values
  - css module for managing appearance of elements through logical directions and dimension mappings
    - logical properties describe the direction which they flow
      - block
        - the order in which blocks are displayed on the page
      - inline
        - the direction which a text line is written
        - e.g english is left to right, top to bottom
- scroll snapping
  - determines the rigidity with which attachment poitns are applied to the scroll container
  - i.e. locks the viewport to certain elemnets/locations after the user has finsihed scrolling
    - e.g. for image galleries or full-height|width content
- flexbox, grid, and subgrid
- media queries
  - especially the new level 4

#### effects, trends, etc

- parallax effect
  - layering graphics, images and text while tying their moving to scroll position at differnet speeds
  - use cases
    - make soething more dynamic and itneresting
- overlapping elements
  - e.g. solid colors, behind an imge, behind text, each artistically visible and possibly animated at different speeds/scroll positions
- breakup content with offset headers, subheaders and columns
  - instead of rigid symmetry, offset shit
- horizontal cards
  - great for smaller screens where scroll is done vertically
- split screens
  - great for large screens
  - break up big blocks of content, where each sdie of the screen is dedicated to differnet parts of the same content, e.g header + image vs paragraph text
- using the foreground and background axis artistically
- use cards/sliders instead of scrolling content

## html

### content categories

- metadata: link, meta, style
- flow: a, p, strong, button
- sectioning: header, aside, nav
- heading, h1, h2 h3,
- phrasing, span, input, cite
- ebedded, audio, canvas, video
- interactive, textarea, a, select

### elements

- img: embeds an image into the page at the position it appears
- layout elements
  - header
  - nav
  - main / article / section / div
  - aside

  - address
  - sup / sub
- times and dates
  - time
- computer code

### anatomy of an HTML document

- doctype: always include for things to work right
- ht

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>My test page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

### forms

- forms separate users from companies
- someone wants to buy something, someone wants to sell something
- someone wants to grow their userbase, someone wants to be part of a community/team/fanbase/etc
- placeholders should be used as an aid to guide users
  - provide immediate feedback to users
  - best practices
    - use existing data to pre-populate fields
    - ensure forms are auto-fillable by browsers
    - always show progress meters
    - dont break the back button
    - provide visual calendars when selecting dates
    - use datalist to provide suggestions 'for' form inputs
      .users are not restricted to the suggestions provided
    - use labels on form inputs, and make them visible
    - use placheolders to provide guidance
    - use established names 'for' elements and include the autocomplete attribute
    - use the browsers built in validation attributes like pattern, required, min, and max
    - use javascript and the constraints validation api 'for' complex validation
    - manage focus when validation fails
    - autocorrect when you can
    - show validation errors in real time

```js
// labels
  label.for='someInputId'
  input.id='someInputId'

// inputs
  input.placeholder='show this text when no user input exists'
  input.type='datetime-local' //calendar

  input.autocomplete='email'

// autofocus: only one element can have it, boolean
  input.autofocus='true'

// validation
  // required: if exists, this input needs a value
    input.required

  // custom validation: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement/setCustomValidity>
    input.value='blah'
    submit.onclick=()=>{
      if input.value !== 'bloop'
      input.setCustomValidity = 'Input value should be bloop'
    }
  // constraint validation:
    // <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#constraint-validation-api>
    // <https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/constraintvalidation/>
    the algorithm utilizes new HTML5 attributes min, max, step, pattern, and required as well as existing attributes maxlength and type.

    //has error
    el.validity.valueMissing ||
    el.validity.typeMismatch ||
    el.validity.patternMismatch ||
    el.validity.tooLong ||
    el.validity.tooShort ||
    el.validity.rangeUnderflow ||
    el.validity.rangeOverflow ||
    el.validity.stepMismatch ||
    el.validity.badInput ||
    !el.validity.valid;

    // set error + message to user
    el.setCustomValidity(el.validationMessage);
    el.title = el.validationMessage;
    //clear error
    el.setCustomValidity('');
    //check if form is invalid
    if (!e.currentTarget.checkValidity())
    if (formElement.checkValidity())
```

## CSS

### units

- numbers e.g. `20`
- percentage e.g. `20%`
- absolute units

  - cm Centimeters 1cm = 96px/2.54
  - mm Millimeters 1mm = 1/10th of 1cm
  - Q Quarter-millimeters 1Q = 1/40th of 1cm
  - in Inches 1in = 2.54cm = 96px
  - pc Picas 1pc = 1/16th of 1in
  - pt Points 1pt = 1/72th of 1in
  - px Pixels 1px = 1/96th of 1in

- relative units

  - em Font size of the parent element.
  - ex x-height of the elements font.
  - ch The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the elements font.
  - rem Font size of the root element.
  - lh Line height of the element.
  - vw 1% of the viewports width. (be careful with scrollbars!)
  - vh 1% of the viewports height. (be careful with scrollbars!)
  - vmin 1% of the viewports smaller dimension.
  - vmax 1% of the viewports larger dimension.

- colors

  - keywords e.g. red
  - hexadecimal e.g. #ff0000
    - allows us to specify any of the 256 available values for each (16 x 16 = 256.)
  - rgb e.g. rgb(0,0,255)
    - three parameters that represent the red, green and blue channel values of the colors between 0 and 255
  - hsl e.g. hsl(0,100%,50%)
    - accepts hue, saturation, and lightness values, which are used to distinguish between the 16.7 million colors
    - hue: the base shade of the color. This takes a value between 0 and 360, presenting the angles round a color wheel.
    - saturation: how saturated is the color: This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full color saturation
    - how light or bright is the color: This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light (it will appear completely white)
  - rgba & hsla
    - allow you to set an additional `transparency` dimension
      - `rgba(255,0,0,0.5);`
      - `hsla(240,100%,50%,0.5);`

- functions e.g. background images / graduates

### selectors

- specificity: in increasing order

  - Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before).
  - Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).
  - ID selectors (e.g., #example).
  - Universal selector (\*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' ', ||) and negation pseudo-class (:not()) have no effect on specificity. (The selectors declared inside :not() do, however.)
  - !important
    - Always look for a way to use specificity before even considering !important
    - Only use !important on page-specific CSS that overrides foreign CSS (from - - external libraries, like Bootstrap or normalize.css).
    - Never use !important when you're writing a plugin/mashup.
    - Never use !important on site-wide CSS.

- universel selector: selects all elements
- simple: element type, class, id
- attirbute: attribute & attribute values; values are case sensitive unless `i` i specified
- pseudo-classes: based on element state, append keyword to selector
- pseudo-elements: parts of content in a certain position in relation to an element, e.g. first word of a paragraph or some generated content
- combinators: ways of combining two/more selectors for a more precise selection
  - `a,b`: matching a or b
  - `a b`: b is descendant of a
  - `a > b`: b is direct child of a
  - `a + b`: b is direct sibling of a
  - `a ~ b`: b is one of a's siblings
- multiple selectors: applying the same rule to multiple selectors that are separated by commas

- at-rules: used to convey metadata & conditional information e.g. `@IDENTIFIER (RULE);`

  - media query: control the layout of an element based on viewport dimensions/features
    - consits of a media type and zero/more expressions that check for the conditions of particular media features
  - page: modify margins, orphans, widows, and page breaks when printing a document
  - font-face: specify a custom font loaded from a remote/server or user's computer
    - most browsers only download `@font-face` fonts if the font-family is actually used in a CSS declaration
      - so list as many as needed, but be careful how many you actually use
    - use `local()` to specify the name of a locally-installed front, useful for offline styling
  - keyframes: controls the intermediate steps ina CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes/waypoints along the animation sequence

- container queries: control the layout of an element based on its parent element
  - create style rules that respond to the size of a container
  - not ready for production; but there are JS solutions on github

#### media queries

- media types: screen, print, speech, all
  - all other values have been deprecated (check w3c)
  - the focus now is on capabilities and functionality

```css
@media print {
  .someclass {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

/* landscape vs portrait
 * landscape: browser window is wider than it is tall
 * portrait: the opposite
 */
@media (orientation: portrait) {
}

/** general width base queries */
@media all and (min-width: 480px) {
  /* use min-width for  mobile first designs */
}

@media all and (max-width: 700px) {
  /* use max width for dekstop first designs */
}

@media all and (min-width: 700px) and (max-width: 2000px) {
  /* can be combined */
}

/** black n white */
@media (monochrome) {
  /* black n white  or grayscale */
}

@media (monochrome: 0) {
  /* i.e. not monochrome */
}

/* screen resolution
 * good for swapping out background images
*/
@media (resolution: 240dpi) {

```

### layouts

- organized the content first in a well structured layout in the normal flow

  - before applying any CSS

- normal flow

  - default display and lyaout of elements when no CSS has been applied
  - elements displayed in HTML order
  - normal flow element types
    - block level elements:
      - full width of containing element
      - height of content
      - separated by margin
        - margin collapsing: when two element's margins occupy the same space; the Math.max(marginX,marginY,etc) === total margin used between elements
    - inline elements:
      - take width of content
  - stacking order: as defined in HTML, all elements in the same zindex (0)

- box model: 5 properties that define how an element takes up space, i.e the total area of an element, plus 4 positioning offsets that are language dependent

  - width/inline-size: should be thought of as the length of the line axis (language dependent)

    - i.e. the inline dimension: the line that the text flows along

  - height/block-size: should be though tof as the length of the perpendicular to line axis (language dependent)

    - i.e. the block dimension: i.e. perpendicular to the inline dimension

  - padding: within element, expands element itself
  - margin: around element, expands space element consumes
  - border: between padding & margin, expands space consumes

  - top/block-start:
  - right/inline-end:
  - bottom/block-end:
  - left/inline-start:

  - logical properties: enable the developer to logically apply box model properties to all languages, regardless of the direction in which the text flows
    - can be appended to any box model property (see top,right,bottom,left above)
    - without logical properites
      - left-to-right languages work as expected
      - right-to-left languages cause the 2 of 4 offsets to reverse horizontally
      - top-to-bottom languages cause the 2 of 4 offsets to reverse vertically

- box-sizing property: sets the algorithm for how the box model determines the total area an element consumes

  - gotchas

    - computedSize = width + height
    - margin still adds additional space to the area the element consumes

  - content-box: element size = computedSize + padding + border
    - i.e. increases the total area when adding padding + border
  - border-box: element size = (computedSize - (padding + border)) + padding + border
    - i.e. maintains the computed size of the width + height

- display property
  - block
  - inline
  - flex
  - grid

#### floats

- floated elements are removed from normal flow
- any element following a floated element will fill the space around it
  - but text content will wrap around floated content
- parent elements will only recognize the height of non floated elements
  - thats why you have to clear a float, so that the height of the floated element is respected by the parent

#### positioning

- arrange elements relative to their current position, containing element, or the browser viewport
  - all positioned elements accept
    - the zindex to control the zed dimension
    - top,left,right,bottom offsets
- static, sticky, & relative all leave the surrounding content unchanged
- absolute & fixed affect the surrounding content (because the element is taken out of the normal flow)

- static: by default all elements start with their position set to static: i.e. determined by the normal flow of HTML source
- relative: element stays in the normal flow but can be offset without affecting surrounding elements
  - great for creating an ancestor for children elements
- sticky: make an element stick relative to its containing block & viewport
  - element renders as relative positioned,
  - until its containing block (usually immediate parent) hits the specified threshold/offset, then its renders as fixed to the viewport
  - until it the sticky element meets the opposite end of its containing block, then it goes back to relative and scrolls with the viewport
- absolute: removes element from the normal flow
  - is relative to the closest positioned ancestor/body
  - other elements take up the space the absolutely positioned element previously consumed
- fixed: keeps an element on screen, regardless of scroll position

#### flexbox & Grid

- useful terms

  - grid: pattern used by designers to align design elements for consistent flow & symmetrical layouts
    - equal width rows & columns are added as guides
      - generually using 12 columns, as its divisible by 2,3,4,6 for targeting general devices & creating consistent designs
    - gutters are added for consistent spacing between elements
    - design elements are then placed on the grid
  - CSS grid systems: predefined style rules are tried to grid/column-specific class names
    - e.g. col-1 === 1/12 width, col-4 === 4/12 width, col8 === 8/12 width, etc

- Versus rap battle

  - both

    - can use any css length unit, e.g. %, vh, px, rem, etc
      - but both works best with `fr`
      - ^ fractional unit: you dont specify the `fr` in flex, but you do in grid
        - 1 === distribute evently
        - 2 = give this one 2/totalColsOrRows etc

  - GRID:

    - layout in layout: the specified layout truly controls the layout, child element content are forced to fit within the specifications
    - 2 dimensions at the same time
    - additional groups of items have the same dimensions as previous group by defualt
    - declare dimensions for grid-items in the parent, via a single property

  - FLEXBOX
    - content out layout: the child elements content truly controls the layout of the box model
    - 1 dimension
    - additional groups of items (when wrapping) have their own dimensions
    - declare dimensions for flex-items on the flex item, via multiple properties

##### flexbox

- gotchas
  - dont use the width property on flex items, use flex-basis (or just flex)
- 1-dimensional alignment of content, ordering items, and implementing flexible sizing

  - the ability to make the flex items flexible, altering their width/height to fill the availble space in the main dimension
  - while it dictates behavior on a single axis
    - items can wrap to create additional groupings
    - flex containers can be nested to create additional dimensions

- flex-direction: determines which dimension is the main & cross axis

  - but also depends on the writing order of the document
  - column: consider height & ignore width
  - row: consider width & ignore height

  - row: the parent is a row, children render left to right, additional rows created when wrapping
    - width is an input var to the flex algorithm
    - main axis: horizontal
      - items start & end -> left to right
    - cross axis: vertical for row
      - items start & end -> top to bottom
  - row-reverse: flips start & end on both dimensions

  - column: the parent is a column, children render top to bottom, additional columns created when wrapping
    - height is an input var to the flex algorithm
    - when wrapping occurs, additional columns are created
    - main axis: vertical
      - items start & end -> top to bottom
    - cross axis: horizontal
      - items start & end -> left to right
  - column-reverse: flips start & end on both dimensions

- flex-wrap: is per group on main axis

  - i.e. if you set to wrap,
    - and 2 groups are created are created on the main axis (because there wasnt enough space on first group)
      - flex-items in the second group will have there own computed values
      - e.g. the first group of 4 is 10px each, whlie the second group of 2 is 20 px each

- order: change the visual layout order of flex items without changing the HTML
  - default is 0 for all flex items
  - 1 -> first item on main exis, incremented as expected
  - -1 -> before 0, etc

##### grid

- designed for two dimensional layouts at hte same time

- grid lines: based on language direction (i.e. left -> right & top -> bottom)

  - divide the grid into cols & rows
  - top left is 1,1 for eng,

- grid-template-row|column

  - defines the CSS grid
  - grid items will equal exactly 1 col & 1 row by default

- grid-row|column

  - defines how specific items span rows & columns

- grid-auto-flow: how grid items are placed in the grid items
  - row: rows are filled first (e.g. left to right)
  - column: columns are filled first (e.g. top to bottom)
  - row|column dense: fill any gaps for grid items that are manually positioned
    - you generally always want to specify dense
    - unless the order of the grid items matter (as empty spaces are backfilled)
