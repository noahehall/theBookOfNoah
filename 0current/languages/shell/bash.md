# bash scripting

- most of this should have come straight from the bash pocket ref
- hopefully this will be my last bash cheatsheet

## links

- likely should check out the scripting.md file for links

## basics

- bourne shell
  - original bourne shell was 1979 via the V7 Unix
  - found in `/bin/sh` (but I think somewhere this is no longer shell, but some other version on new systems)
- POSIX standard: defines the `standard shell` language & behavior based on the System V Bourne SHell
- Bash: by the Free Software Foundation; clone of the Bourne Shell written from scrach
  - in/output redirection
  - wildcard chars for filename abreviatiation
  - shell vars & options for customizing the env
  - builtin command set for writing shell programs
  - shell functions
  - job control
  - command-line editing (using the cmd syntax of vi/emacs)
  - editable cmd history
  - integer arithmetic
  - arrays and airthmetic expressions
  - cmd name abbreviation (aliases)
  - upwards compliance with POSIX
  - internationalization facilities
  - arithmetic for loop
