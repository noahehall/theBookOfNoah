# introduction
## terminology
  - Domain Driven Design
    1. primary focus should be on the domain and domain logic
    2. complex domain designs should be based on a model
  - Domain design practices
    - development is iterative: read some books on agile/extreme programming
    - developers and domain experts have a close relatinoship
  - Domain Modeling
    - dont separate the concepts from the implementation
    - you cannot build a useful conceptual model without considering implimitation issues
    - the greatest value of a domain model is that it provides a ubiquotous language that ties domain experts and technologists
  - complexity
    - it is the approach to design that largely determines how complex software will become
  - continuous learning
    - highly productive teams grow their knowledge consciously:
      - technology knowledge
      - general domain modeling skills
      - and expertise in the domain at hand
  - knowledge rich design:
    - business activities and rules are as control to a domain as are the entities involved

## design patterns and factors
  - strategy: i.e. a policy, usually motivated by the need to substitute different rules:
    - keep these methods in a policy class, e.g. checkBalancePolicy
  - factors:
    - technological
    - domain: the activity of the business/user itself
  - deep models:  useful models seldom lie on the surface; you need a deep understanding of the domain and the application to truly build a sueful model
  - communication and the use of language: a domain model can be a common langauge for a software project

## terminology
  - model: simplification of some reality
