      - ensure bidirectional data flowing through your api is correct in all envs
    - documentation generation 
      - create human-readbale docs based ont he machine-readble description via automation 
    - code generation 
      - automated creatino of both server and client code in any programming language
    - graphical editors 
      - creation of description files using a gui instead of typing them by hand
        - fk ur gui wheres the one-liner xterm?
    - mock servers

    - security analysis
      - discover potential vulnerabilities at the api design stage
    - openapi marketing selling points
