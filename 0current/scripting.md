# best Practices    
  - always trap signals
  - use builtin cmds > everything else (quicker)
  - always enable POSIX mode (see notes about POSIX special buitins)

# builtin cmds
  - `sh`
    - break
    - cd
    - continue
    - eval
    - exec
    - exit
    - export
    - getopts
    - hash
    - pwd
    - readonly
    - return
    - set
    - shift
    - test
    - `[`
    - times
    - trap
    - umask
    - unset
  - `bash`
    - alias
    - bind
    - builtin
    - command
    - declare
    - echo
    - enable
    - help
    - let
    - local
    - logout
    - printf
    - rea
    - shopt
    - type
    - typeset
    - ulimit
    - unalias
  - POSIX (special builtins)
    - 3 differences with specials 
      - special builtins are found before shell functions during cmd lookup
      - causes non-interactive shells to exit on error
      - assignments preceding the special builtin exist in the shell env after the cmd completes
    - break
    - continue
    - eval
    - exec
    - export
    - readonly
    - return
    - set
    - shift
    - trap
    - unset


# conditionals
  - `[[`
  - `test`
