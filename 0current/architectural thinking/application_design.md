# application design patterns

- specific to the internals of a single application, restricted by the application architecture

  - the structural composition of the software program
  - the interactions between software elements
  - during the process of writing software code, edevelopers encounter similar problems multiple times within a roject/compony
    - design patterns give engineers a reusable way to solve recurring problems

- builder
- factory: abstracts implementation details of instantiating entities
- repository: abstract implementation details on how to retrieve data; logic for retrieving, validating and translating responses from a data service
- singleton
- tryparse: pattern for trying some logic and returning the response, but on error returning the given substitute instead of throwing the exception
- interface oriented design
- domain driven development
- chain of responsibility pattern
- aggregator pattern

- MVC: model view controller
- MVP: model view presenter
- MVVM: model view view model
