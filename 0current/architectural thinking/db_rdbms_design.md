# terminology
   - `data redundancy`
      -  a situation that occurs in a database when a field needs to be updated in more than one table
      - issues
         - inconsistency in data format
         - same information being kept in several different places
         - problems maintaijning consistency after updates
      - benefits
         - can sometimes lead to performance improvements
            - e.g. in place of a db join to connect data
   - `data inconsistency`
      - a situation where various copies of the same data are conflicting
      - issues
         - wastes storage space
         - duplicates efforts
   - `data isolation`
      - a property that determines when and how changes made by one operation become visible to other concurrent users and systems
   - `data integrity`
      - the maintenance and assurance that the data in a database are correct and consistent
         - data values must satisfy certain consistency constraints that are specified in the application programs
         - difficulty in making changes to the application programs in order to enforce new constraints
   - `concurrency`
      - the ability of the database to allow multiple users access/modify the same record without adversely affecting transaction processing
   - `data`
      - factual information such as measurements or statistics about objects and concepts
   - `data element`
      - a single fact/piece of information
   - `metadata`
      - defines and describes the data and relationships between tables in the database
   - `data independence`
      - refers to the immunity of user applications to changes made in the definition and organization of data
      - `logical schema`
         - i.e. `conceptual schema`
         - a conceptual design of the database
      - `logical data independence`
         - the ability to change the `logical schema` without changing the `external schema` (i.e. user view)
         - i.e. changes tot he logical schema (e.g. alterations to the structure of the database like adding a column/tables) should not affect the function of the application (external views)
      - `physical data independence`
         - refers to the immunity of the internal model to changes in the physical model
         - i.e. the `logical schema` stays unchanged even though changes are made to the file organization/storage structures/storage devices/indexing strategy
   - `insertion anomaly`
      - occurs when you are innserting inconsisten information into a table
   - `update anomaly`
      - changing existing information incorrectly
   - `deletion anomaly`
      - occurs when you delete a record that kmay contain attributes that shouldnt be deleted

# fundamental concepts

## database types
   - based on data model
      - relational (e.g. mysql)
         - table oriented
      - hierarchical
      - network
      - objects (e.g. mongodb)
         - object-oriented
         - combine database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities
   - based on user numbers
      - single-user database
         - only supports one user at a time
      - multiuser database
         - supports multiple concurrent users
   - based on distribution
      - centralized systems
         - the dbms and database are stored at a single site that is used by several other systems too
      - distributed database system
         - the actual database and the dbms software are distributed fromvarious sites that are connected by a computer network
      - homogeneous distributed database systems
         - use the same dbms software from multiple sites to permit data exchange beteween these various sites
         - e.g. buyer and seller using the same DBMS software and interfacing with each others data
      - heterogeneous distributed database systems

## database
   - a shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization
   - properties
      - a representation of some aspect of the real world or a collection of data elements(facts) representing real world information
      - is logical, coherent and internally consistent
      - designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose
      - each data item is stored in a field
      - a combination of fields make up a table
   - database management system (DBMS)
      - collection of programs that enable users to create and maintain databases and control all access to them
      - provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information

   - `schema`
      - overall description of a database
      - usually represented by the `entity relationship diagram` i.e. `ERD`
      - items to consider
         - external schemas
         - subschemas: display multiple external views of the data
         - conceptual schemas; there is only one, includes data items, relationships and constraints
            - all represented by an ERD
            - i.e. `logical schema`
         - physical schema

## integrity rules and constraints
   - ensure that users enter valid information and maintain data integrity
   - `database constraint`
      - allow a designer to specify the semantics of the data in the database
         - are the rules that force DBMSs to check that data satisfies the semantics
      - a restriction or rule that dictates what can be entered/edited in a table
      - e.g. a postel code using a certain format
   - `data type`
      - determines the sort of data permitted in a field
   - `data uniqueness`
      - ensures that no duplicates are entered
   - `domain integrity`
      - the values of attributes in the relatn and a constrain of the relational model
   - `entity integrity`
      - every table have a primary key
   - `referential integrity`
      - requires that a foreign key must have a matching primary key or it must be null
      - specified between two tables (parent and child)
      - maintains the correspondonce between rows in these tables
         - i.e. the reference form a row in one table to another table must be valid
      - `orphan record`
         - one whose foreign key value is not found in the corresponding entity
            - the entity where the pk is located
   - `forein key` rules
      - what to do with child rows when the record with the PK  is deleted or updated
   - `enterprise constraints`
      - i.e. semantic constraints
      - are additional rules specified by users or a database administerors and can be based on  multiple tables
         - e.g.
         - a class can have a maximum of 30 students
         - a teacher can teadhca  maximum of four classes per semester
         - an employee cannot otake part in more than five projects
         - the salary of an employee cannot exceed the salary of the employees manager
   - `business rules`
      - obtained from users when gathering equirements
      - requirements need to be verified by the users before tehe database  design is built
      - e.g.
      - see `enterprise constraints` examples
      - determines cardinality and connectivity
   - `cardinality`
      - describes the relationship between two data tables by expressing the minimum and maximum number of entity occurrences associated with one occurrence of a related entity
   - `connectivity`
      - the relationship between two tables
      - e.g.
         - 1:1
         - 1:m

## tables
   - a combination of fields
   - has a name that is distinct form all other tables in the database
   - contains no duplicate records
   - entries in columns are atomic; the table does not contain repeating groups or mulitivalued attributes
   - entries from columns are from the same domain based on their data type
   - operatings combining different data types are disallowed
   - each attribute has a distinct name
   - the squence of columns is insignificant
   - the sequence of rows is insignificant

### attribute types
   - simple attributes
      - those drawn from the atomic value domains;
      - single value attributes
      - e.g. firstname, age
   - composite attributes
      - composite attributes are those that consist of a hierarchy of attributes
      - e.g. address,
   - multivalued attributes
      - have a set of values for each entity
      - e.g. types of degrees (phd, associates, etc)
   - derived attributes
      - contain values calculated from other attributes
      - e.g. age derived from birthdate

### keys
   - `unique`
      - no two rows in a tablle may have teh same value at any time
   - `minimal`
      - every column is necessary in order to attain uniqueness
   - `candidate key`
      - simple/composite key that is unique and minimal
   - `composite key`
      - composed of two or more attributes, but it must be minimal
   - `primary key`
      - a `candidate key` that is selected by the database designer to be used as an identifying mechanism for the whole entity set
      - must be unique, non null
   - `secondary key`
      - an attribute used strictly for retrieval purposes
   - `alternate key`
      - candidate keys not chosen as the `primary key`
   - `foreign key`
      - an attribute in a table that references the primary key in another table or it can be null
      - both foreign and primary keys must be of the same data type

### relationships
   - used to connect related finformation between tables
   - `relationship strength`
      - based on how the primary key of a related entity is defined
      - `weak`
         - non-identifying relationship exits if the preeimary key of the related enteity does not contain a primary key compoent of the parent entity
      - `strong`
         - identifying relationship exists when the primary  key of the related entity contains the primary key component of the parent entity
   - optional relationship
      - the fk can be null/parent table does not need to have a corresponding table occurence
   - mandatory relationship
      - one entity occrrence requires a corresponding entity occurrence
      -
   - non-identifying relationship
      - where the PK does not contain the FK
   - identifying relationship
      - where the PK contains the FK
   - `one-to-many`
      - 1:m
      - department:employees
      - the normal in most relational db design
   - `many-to-many`
      - m:n
      - projects:employees
      - cannot be implemented as such in a relational model
      - can be changed into two 1:m relationships
      - involves the implementation of a composite entity
         - must contain at least the primary keys of the original tables
      - creates two/more 1:m relationships
      - steps
         - for each M:N binary relationship, identify two relations
         - A and B represent two entity types participating in R
      - create a new relation S to represent R
      - S needs to contgain the PKs of A and b.
      - these together can be the PK in the S table
   - `unary relationship` (recursive)
      - one in which a relationship exists between occurences of the same entity set
      - i.e the primary and foreign keys are the same
         - but they represent two entities with different roles
         -
      - e.g. employee:supervisor
   - `ternary relationships`
      - e.g. supplier:(project, part)
      - involes many-to-many between three tables
      - steps
         - for each `n-ary` (>2) relationship, create a new relation to represent the relationship
         - the primary key of the new relation is a combination of the primary key sof hte participating entities that hold the N (many) side
         -

### data types
   - `null`
      - either unknown or inapplicable or missing
      - does not mean zero/blank
      - not permitted in primary key
      - a

# security

## access
   - `read-only`
   - `read and write`

# backup and recovery

# database development process
   1. requirements gathering
      - the db designers interview the customers (database users) to understand the proposed system and obtain an document the data and functional requirements
      - all users must agree as to what persistent data they want to store along with an agreement as to the meaning and interpretation of the data elements
      - `data requirements document`
         - includes the detailed requirements provided by the users
         - used to confirm the understanding of requirements with users
         - should not describe how the data is to be processed
         - should decribe
            - what the data items are
            - what attributes they have
            - what constraints apply and the relationships that hold between the data items
# database design
   - `data model`
      - a collection of concepts or notations for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and data constraints
      - most data models also include a set of basic operations for manipulating data in the database
   - avoiding anomalies
      - ensure that all tables are normalized by understandinng functional dependencies
   - broad outline
      1. ER modelling
         - entity relationship diagrams provide the big picture, or macro view of an organizations data requirements and operations
         - an iterative process that involves identifying relevant entities, their attributes and their relationship
      2. db design
         - normalization
      3. blah
      4. blah
      - notes
         - steps 1 and 2 should happen concurrently

## degrees of data abstraction
   - in decreasing levels of abstraction

   - external models
      - represent the user(s) view of the database
         - there will likely be more than one user type (e.g. API, website, or actual users submitting queries)
         - each user type will have different needs
      - contain multiple different external views
         - each view should satisfy a specific users requirements
      - closely related to the real world as perceived by each user
      - requires the designer to subdivide a set of requirements and constraints into functional modules that can be examined within the framework of their external models
         - e.g. HR vs SALES
      - the designer needs to understand all the data so that you can build an enterprise-wide database

   - conceptual models
      - present a community view: the logical structure of the entire database
      - contain data stored in the database
      - show relationships among data including:
         - constraints
         - semantic infomration (e.g. business rules)
         - security and integrity information
      - consider a database as a collection of entities (objects) of various kinds
      - are the basis for identification and high level description of main data objects; they avoid details
      - are database independent regardless of the database you will be using
      -

   - internal models (i.e. logical design)
      - dependent on the selected DBMS
      - a representation of the database as seen by the DBMS
      - create all the tables, constraints, keys, rules, etc
      - consider a database as a collection of fixed-size records
      - are closer to the physical level or file structure
      - are a representation of the database as seen by the DBMS
      - require the designer to match the coneptual models characteristics and constraints to those of the selected implementation model
      - involve mapping the entities in the conceptual model the tables in the relational model
      - examples
         - relational data model, network data model, hierarchical data model

   - physical models
      - are the physical representation of the database
      - have the lowest level of abstractions
      - are how the data is stored; dealing with
         - run-time performance
         - storage utlization and compression
         - file organization and access methods
         - data encryption
   -
## 1 data modelling
   - first step in the process of database design
   - i.e. conceptual design
   - objectives
      - identify the business rules
      - describe the data contained in the database
      - describe the relationships between data items
      - describe the contraints on data

### ER modelling
   - entity relationship modelling

   - `functional dependency`
      - describe how individual attributes are related
      - a kind of constraint among attributes within a relation and constribute to a good relational schema design
      - ensures that all attributes in a table belong to that table
         - eliminates redundancies and anomalies
      - typically is a relationship between the PK and other non-key attributes within a table
         - for any relation R, attribute Y is functionally dependent on attribute X (usually the PK) if for every valid instance of X, that value of X uniquely determines the value of Y
         - **X ----> Y**
         - x = the determinant
         - y = the dependent

   - `armonstrongs axioms`
      - set of inference rules used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database

      - `axiom of reflexivity`
         - if Y is a subset of X, then X determines Y

      - `axiom of augmentation`
         - if X determines Y, then XZ determines YZ for any Z
         - i.e. partial dependency
            - this is NOT good
            - the tables need to be separated into multiple tables
         - says that every non-key attribute must be fully dependent on the PK
      - `axiom of transitivity`
         - if X determines Y, and Y determines Z, then X must also determine Z
         - this is NOT GOOD
         - because a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute
            - whereas all non-key attributes should be dependent on the PK
   - `union rule`
      - suggests that if two tables are separate but the PK is the same, perhaps they should be a single table
         - if X determines Y and X determines Z then X must also determine Y and Z
   - `decomposition`
      - oposite of `union rule`
      - if you have a table that appears to contain two entities thhat are detemrined by the same PK, consider breaking them up into two tables
      - if X determines Y and Z, then X determines Y and X determines Z separately
      -

## 2 DB design ???
   - the data items, relationships and the constraints are all expressed using the concepts provided by the high-level data model
   - useful to ensure all the users requirements are met
   - must capture all of the necessary attributes and associations with the minimal amount of stored information and no redundant data

### normalization
   - focuses on the characteristics of specific entities and represents the micro view of entities within an ERD
   - process of determining how much redundancy exists in a table
   - goals
      - be able to characterize the level of redundancy in a relational schema
      - provide mechanisms for transforming schemas in order to remove redundancy
      - make sure that proposed entities meet required normal form before table structures are created
   - semantic rules
      - business rules applied to the database
   - six `normal forms` (nf)
      - each form involves a set of dependency properties that a schema must satisfy and each normal form gives guarantees about hte presence and/or absence of update anomalies
      - the higher normal forms have less redundancy, and as a result, fewer update problems

      1. first normal form (1NF)
         - only single values are permitted at the intersection of each row and column
         - i.e no repeating groups
         - to normalize a relation that contains aa repating group, remove the repeating group and form two new relations
            - the pk of the new relation is a combination of hte k of the original relation plus an attribute from the newly created relation for unique identification
      2. second normal form (2NF)
         - the relation must be in 1NF
         - the PK comprises a single attribute
         - if the relation has a composite PK
            - each non-key attribute must be fully dependent on the entire PK and not on a subset of PK
               - i.e. there must be no partial dependency augmentation
      3. third normal form (3NF)
         - the relation must be in 2NF
         - all transitive dependencies must be removed
            - a non key attribute may not be functionally dependent on another non key attribute
      4. boyce-codd normal form (BCNF)
         - rarely used
         - is a special case of 3NF
         - a relation is in BCNF if every determinant is a candidate key
-

## 3 database implementation and operations/user interfaces
   - `database logical design`
      - defines a database in a data model of a specific DBMS
      - where you create all the tables, constrains, keys, rules etc.
   - `database physical design`
      - defines the internal database storage structure, file organization or indexing techniques

## data models
   - `high-level conceptual models`
      - provide concepts for presenting data in ways that are close to the way people perceive data
      - examples
         - entity relationship model
   - `record-based logical models`
      - provide concepts users can understand but are not too far from the way data is stored in the computer
      - examples
         - relationship model


### entity relationship model
   - high-level conceptual data model
   - `entity`
      - represents a real world object such as an employee or a project or a concept
      - defined as tables that hold specific information/data
   - `entity strength`
      - weak - when the entities tables are `existence dependent`
         - it cannot exist without a relationship with another entity
         - its primary key is derived from the primary key of the parent entity
         - mandatory foreign key (i.e. cannot be null)
         - used to connect two kernels together
         - many to many relationships
      - strong - when the entities tables can exist  apart from all of its related entities
         - `kernels`
            - building blocks of the database
            - the primary key may be simple or composite
            - primary key is not a foreign key
            - do not depend on another entity for their existence
         - a table without a forein key
         - a table that contains a forein key that can contain nulls
   - `characteristic entities`
      - provide more information about another table
      - represent multivalued attributes
      - decribe other entities
      - typically have one-to-many relationships
   - `attributes`
      - represent properties of an entity
   - `relationship`
      - represents an association among entities
      - e.g. an employ works on many projects
   - `entity type`
      - defines a collectionn of similar entities
   - `entity set`
      - a collection of entities of an entity type at a particular point of time
      - e.g.
         - entity type - employee
         - entity set - list of employes on date X
      -

### relationship/relational model
   - represents data as relations/tables
   - `relation`
      - table/file - a subset of the cartesian product of a list of domains charactered by a name
      - within a table each row/record/tuple represents a group of related data values
   - `domain`
      - the original sets of atomic values used to model data
   - `atomic value`
      - each value in the domain is individisble as far ast her elational model is concerned
      - i.e. a set of acceptable values that a column is allowed to contain
      - e.g.
         - the domain of marital status
            - married, single divorced
         - the domain of shift
            - mon, tues, wed...
   -


### network model
   - represents data as record types

### hierarchical model
   - represents data as a hierarchical tree structure
   - each branch of the hierarchy represents a number of related records


## Diagrams
   - `entity relationship diagram`
      - i.e. ERD
      - a data model describing the database showing tables, attributes and relationship
   - `dependency diagram`
      - illustrates the various dependencies that exist in a table
