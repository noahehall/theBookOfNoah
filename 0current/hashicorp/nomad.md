## terms

- agent: processing running on a server in server/client mode
- dev agent: runs in server & client mode and does not persist state to disk, useful for experiments and development only
- server: agent running in server mode
- leader: server agent responsible for cluster mgmt
- follower: server agent that isnt the leader
- client: agent running in client mode, executes tasks assigned from servers
- job: one/more task groups with one/more tasks
- job specification: schema for nomad jobs
- task group: set of tasks that must run together
- task driver: means of executing a task, e.g. docker
- task: smallest unit of work in nomad, executed by task drivers
- allocation: mapping between a task group in a job and a client node, created by server agents to assign jobs to client agents
- evaluation: how nomad makes scheduling decisions
- bin packing: scheduling algorithm; attempts to create the most-desnse arrangement deployments to decrease costs related to over-provisioning
- spread scheduling: opposite of binpacking, goal is to distribute deployment loads across as many machines as possible
- gossip protocol: used to connect all the server instances together

## components

### UI

- by default runs on http://localhost:4646

#### jobs

- lists all jobs, click to see status (like `nomad job status`)

#### servers

- view of all server agents

##### monitor

- nomad application logs with option to set the log level

#### clients

- view of all client agents

#### topology

- view of the cluster and running workload, useful for complex nomad environments

### agents

- long running (but lightweight) process that must run on every machine in the cluster
- registers the host machine with (cluster) server agents
- performs heart-beating
- runs tasks assigned to them

### jobs

### schedular

### variables

#### interpolation

- two types of variable interpolation: node attributribes and runtime environment vars
- node attributes: in constraints, task env vars, and certain driver fields
- runtime env vars: not itnerpretable in constraints because they are only defined once the scheduler has place them on a particular node

## network env vars

NOMAD_IP_<label>	# Host IP for the given port label. See here for more information.
NOMAD_PORT_<label>	# Port for the given port label. Driver-specified port when a port map is used, otherwise the host's static or dynamic port allocation. Services should bind to this port. See here for more information.
NOMAD_ADDR_<label>	# Host IP:Port pair for the given port label.
NOMAD_HOST_PORT_<label>	# Port on the host for the port label. See here for more information.

NOMAD_UPSTREAM_IP_<service> #	IP for the given service when defined as a Consul Connect upstream.
NOMAD_UPSTREAM_PORT_<service> #	Port for the given service when defined as a Consul Connect upstream.
NOMAD_UPSTREAM_ADDR_<service>	# Host IP:Port for the given service when defined as a Consul Connect upstream.
NOMAD_ENVOY_ADMIN_ADDR_<service> #	Local address 127.0.0.2:Port for the admin port of the envoy sidecar for the given service when defined as a Consul Connect enabled service. Envoy runs inside the group network namespace unless configured for host networking.
NOMAD_ENVOY_READY_ADDR_<service>	# Local address 127.0.0.1:Port for the ready port of the envoy sidecar for the given service when defined as a Consul Connect enabled service. Envoy runs inside the group network namespace unless configured for host networking.

## consule related env vars

CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR	# Specifies the address to the local Consul agent. Will be automatically set to a unix domain socket in bridge networking mode, or a tcp address in host networking mode.
CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN	# Specifies the Consul ACL token used to authorize with Consul. Will be automatically set to a generated Connect service identity token specific to the service instance if Consul ACLs are enabled.
CONSUL_HTTP_SSL	# Specifies whether HTTPS should be used when communicating with consul. Will be automatically set to true if Nomad is configured to communicate with Consul using TLS.
CONSUL_HTTP_SSL_VERIFY #	Specifies whether the HTTPS connection with Consul should be mutually verified. Will be automatically set to true if Nomad is configured to verify TLS certificates.
CONSUL_CACERT #	Specifies the path to the CA certificate used for Consul communication. Will be automatically set if Nomad is configured with the consul.share_ssl option.
CONSUL_CLIENT_CERT #	Specifies the path to the Client certificate used for Consul communication. Will be automatically set if Nomad is configured with the consul.share_ssl option.
CONSUL_CLIENT_KEY	# Specifies the path to the CLient Key certificate used for Consul communication. Will be automatically set if Nomad is configured with the consul.share_ssl option.
CONSUL_TLS_SERVER_NAME #	Specifies the server name to use as the SNI host for Consul communication. Will be automatically set if Consul is configured to use TLS and the task is in a group using bridge networking mode.

## provisioning

- wow made it to the end! you should now have enuff knowledge to deploy and operate a nomad cluster

### general workflow

- new jobs
  - create a job specification
  - plan and review changes with a nomad server
  - submit job file to a nomad server
  - review job status and logs
- exiting jobs
  - modify existing job file
  - plan and review changes with a nomad server
  - submit job file to nomad server
  - review job status and logs

## examples

```json

job "poop" {
  datacenters = [str]
  type = str
  update {
    max_parallel = num
    min_health_time = str
    health_deadline = str
    progress_deadline = str
    auto_revert = bool
    canary = num
  }
  migrate {
    max_parallel
    health_check
    min_healthy_time
    healthy_deadline
  }
  group "cache" {
    count
    network {
      port "db" {
        to =

        tags
        port
        provider
      }
      restart {

        interval
        delay
        mode
      }
      ephemeral_disk {

      }
      task "redis" {

        config {
          {...driver config...}
        }
        resources {
