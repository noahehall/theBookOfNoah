# accessibility

## `best practices` 
  - use a button instead of a link when 
    - the link is empty/has no `href` attribute
    - the link has an `onclick` handler
  
  - dont add redundant aria `landmark` roles to html5 semantic elements
    - `role='banner'` === `<header>`
    - `role='complementary'` === `<aside>`
    - `role='contentinfo'` === `<footer>`
    - `role='form'` === `<form>`
    - `role='main`' === `<main>`
    - `role='navigation'` === `<nav>`
    - `role='region'` === `<section>`



## gotchas
  - dont confuse `button` with `a.role='button'`
    - links activated via `enter` and `return` 
    - buttons activated via `spacebar`
    - `role='button'` do not add `spacebar` listeners to its element

## the accessibility mindset
    - [apply name, role and value to all user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value)
    - always provide descriptive identifications of content that cannot be made accessible in a meaningful way
    - think: what purpose is this serving, and how do I serve this purpose in another form
      - i.e. what is the purpose of this user interface item: how is this purpose fulfilled for people who cant read/see/perceive colors/ hear/ etc.
    - questions to ask when crafting accessible content
      - what is the information component or user interface component
        - is it text-content or non-text content
      - what is its purpose
      - what is the situation
      - what are the alternative techniques for success in this situation


## terms 
	- user interface components:
	- information components:
  - mainstream user agents: e.g. common web browsers built for people without disabilities, or targeting broad and diverse audiences that usually include people without disabilities
    - provide important functionality to support assistive technologies
      - retrieving web content from program objects
      - parsing markup into identifiable bundles
  
  - [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-assistive-technologies): 
    - target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities
    - hardware/software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents
    - categories:
      - visual reading assistance:
        - target population: people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities 
        - purpose: 
          - change text font, size, sacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc
          - improve the visual readability of rendered text and images
        - examples: screen magnifiers
      - screen readers 
        - target population: people who are blind 
        - purpose: 
          - read textual information through syntesized speech or braille
          - examples:
      - text-to-speech software 
        - target population: people with cognitive, language and learning disabilities 
        - purpose:
          - convert text into synthetic speech 
        - examples:
      - speech recognition software 
        - target population: people with physical disabilities 
        - purpose: 
        - examples
      - alternative keyboards
        - target population: people with physical disabilities 
        - purpose 
          - simulate a normal keyboard
        - examples 
          - head pointers 
          - single switches
          - sip/puff/other special input devices 
      - alternative pointing devices 
        - target population: people with physical disabilities 
        - purpose:
          - simulate mouse pointing 
          - simulate button activations 
        - examples
    
    - features:
      - alternative presentations:
        - synthesized speech
        - magnified content
        - ...
      - alternative input methods 
        - voice
        - ...
      - additional navigation 
      - additional orientation mechanisms
      - content transformations
        - make tables more accessible
    
    - capabilities 
      - monitoring mainstream user agents API invocations (e.g. the HTML5 audio api) to provide alternatives
    - 
  - sensory characteristics: aspects of UI components, e.g. 
    - shape
    - color
    - size
    - visual location
    - orientation
    - sound
  
  


## ARIA
  - ARIA: accessible rich internet applications; set of attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities
    - web accessibility issues cannot be managed with native HTML, ARIA bridges the gap between HTML and assistive technologies

  - main concepts and brief examples
    - `roles`: used to define a typ eof user interface element, e.g. `role=ROLE_NAME`
      
      - `abstract roles`: utilized by user agents (e.g. browsers) and should not be used in code
        - give `roles` their meanings behind the scenes
      
      - `document structure roles`: arent normally interactive, but isntead provide descriptions for sections wihtin a page
        - e.g. `role='img|document|heading|list|listitem|toolbar'`
        - used to identify ontent while navigating a page
        - provides context of the context their viewing 
        - the most robust choice is to use `document structure roles` and `html5 semantic elements` together
      
      - `landmark roles`: for easier navigation, identify eachh section of content within a page
        - e.g. `role='banner|contentinfo|form|main|navigation|search'`
        - assistive technologies will announce the start and end of each landmark role set on a page and display list of these roles/regions (e.g. screen readers do this)
      
      - widget roles: add semantic meaning to elements and user interfaces
        - e.g. standalone widgets `role='alert|button|checkbox|link|menuitem|tab|tabpanel`
        - e.g. composite widgets `role='combobox|grid|listbox|menu|radiogroup|tablist`
        - widge roles are for elements users interact with to get things done
          - e.g. completing forms, open/closing tabs/panels, navigating a main/sidebar menu
    - states and properties
      - used together to suppor ARIA roles existing on a page
      - `states` change based on user interaction or state of UI components via JS event handlers
        - e.g. `checkbox[aria-checked|disabled]`
      - `properties` rarely changed once set
        - e.g. `div[class='fakeinput'][aria-labelledby|describedby]`
      - common states and props
        - `aria-describedby|haspopup|hidden|label|labeledby`
      
      - drag-and-drop attributes
        - conveyes information to assistive technologies about drag-and-drop elements, including draggable elmenets and their drop targets
        - e.g. `aria-dropeffect|grabbed`
      
      - live region attributes
        - indicates changes in content for a users assistive technology, 
        - these elements dont need to have focus and can include infomration on how the user should proceed
          - e.g. whether a message will be read aloud with the flow of content (`aria-alive='polite'`) 
          - e.g. wheter a message will inerrupt the flow of ocntent and be read aloud immediately (`aria-live='assertive'`)
          - e.g. `aria-atomic|busy|live`
      
      - relationship attributes
        - add relationships between elements that cant be determined otherwise
        - for understanding how informatin is related when nevaginat the page and gathering additional data from various elements like forms, menus, tabs/panels 
        - e.g. `aria-describedby|labeledby` 
      
      - widget attributes
        - for common UI elements that receive input from users while processing those actions and information
        - for avoiding confusion and easily utilizing interactive UI elements like forms, overlays/modals/popups
        - e.g. `aria-autocomplete|checked|disabled|label|required`
  

  - rules of aria
    - rule 1
      - dont use aria if there a native HTML element already provides the accessibility support
        - [check the html element here](https://www.html5accessibility.com/)
      - exceptions 
        - the design doenst allow for a specific native element because of limitations on styling
        - the desired accessibility feature isnt uspported by native html
          - [check the accessibility feature status here](https://www.tpgi.com/aria-in-html-there-goes-the-neighborhood/#html5na)
    
    - rule 2
       - do not change the native HTML semantics unless you absolutely have to 
          - ARIA does not get added to the DOM immediately
            - so first get the DOM semantically correct, then add ARIA
            - e.g. instead of `span.role=button` just use a friggin `button`
    
    - rule 3 `tab order` `tabindex`
      - all interactive ARIA controls must be keyboard accessible 
        - add `tabindex='0'` to force them into the logical `tab order` and able to receive keyboard focus

    - rule 4
      - never add `role='presentation'` or `aria-hidden='true'` to a focusable element
        - this will cause them to lose focasibility and be removed from the logical taborder
    
    - rule 5
      - give all interactive elements an accessible name
        - i.e. apply an label element or `aria-label` attribute to all interactive elements (e.g. inputs)  
    
  - common aria use-cases 
    
    - semantics 
      - use appropriate html5 and then aria roles & attributes to provide effective semantic meaning to content 
    
    - descriptive labels
      - whenever you need to provide additional context to HTML elements like buttons or links
        - `aria-label='your extended description'`
    
    - alerts
      - inform assistive technologies of important events in response to user interactions or application life cycles by adding aria `live regions` and `alert messages` to HTML elements
        - `<div class='alert-message' role='alert'>something happened!</div>` 
        - `aria-live=assert`
    
    - relationships
      - use aria attributes on elements who are related
        - e.g. `aria-controls=someid.id=controllerid` && `someelement.id=someid.aria-labeledby=controllerid`
    
    - forms
      - structure
        - organized related sections of a form into fieldsets
      - labeling
        - add aria attributes to form elements to support screen readers and other assistive technologies
      - events
        - use inline form errors that appear next to form control that causes the error
          - e.g. `aria-required` for controls and `aria-autocomplete`
    
    - `tab order` `tabindex`
      - some elements must automaically receive keyboard focus
        - `skip to main content` links 
        - ...TODO
      - some application states require specific `tab order` restraints
        - when a modal/popup/etc is open taborder should be constrained to elements within the component and not be permitted on lower dimensions
    
    - color contrast & intensity
    
    - navigation
      - skip navigation
    
    - image handling
    
    - text resize
    
    - search form and presentation
    
    - drag and drop
    
    - html5 vs aria
      - remove duplicate tags
      - remove null tags



## WCAG: quick reference 
	- link in `specs and stuff` for more information on this section

### principle 1: perceivable 
	- information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
	
	1.1 text alternatives 
		- provide text alternatives for any non-text content
		- examples: large print, braille, speech, symbols, simpler language
		
		1.non-text content (LEVEL A)
			- failures
  			- using CSS to include images that convey important information
  			- text alternatives that do not include information that is conveyed by color differences in the image
  			- not updating text alternatives when changes to non-text content occur
  			- using text alternatives that are **not** alternatives
    			- examples: filenames, placeholder texts
  			- not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that permits assistive technology to ignore them 
  			- providing a text alternative that is **not null** for images that should be ignored by assistive technology 
    			- examples: `alt='spacer'` `alt='image'`
  			- omitting the alt attribute or text alternative on `img`, `area`, and `input.type=image` elements
  			- providing long descriptions for non-text content that does not serve the same purpose/does not present the same information
  			- using text look-alikes to represent text without providing a text alternative

     		- using `pre` element to markup tabular information
     		- inserting non-decorative content by using `:before`or `:after` elements or the `content` property in css
     		- incorrectly associating table headers and content via the `header` and `id` attributes
     		- not correctly marking up table headers
     		- use of `role` presentation on content which conveys semantic information
     		
   		- advisory techniques

     		- organizing a page using headings
   		
       - sufficient techniques

           - TODO: alternative techniques
         
         - situation B: the technology in use does not provide the semantic structure to make the information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable 
           - TODO: alternative techniques
         
		2. meaningful sequence `level a` `tab order` tabindex`
   		- when the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined

      - failures 
        - locking the orientation to landscape/portrait view
      
      - sufficient techniques

        - use of show/hide controls to allow access to content in different orientations  
   		
    5. identify Input Purpose (LEVEL AA)
      - the purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when: 
        - input field serves a purpose identified in the `input purposes for user interface components setion`
        - the content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data 
    
		5. identify purpose (LEVEL AAA)
      - in content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of user interface components, icons and regions can be prorammatically determined

## WCAG: in depth
  - WCAG: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
    - defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities
      - visual:
      - auditory:
      - physical:
      - speech: 
      - cognitive:
      - language:
      - learning:
      - neurological:
    
    
    - WCAG guidance dimensions 
      1. principles: 4 principles provide the foundation for web accessibility 
        - perceivable: information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
          - text alternatives: for any non-text content to be perceivable by users in other forms
            
            - common (sensory perception) forms:
              - print
              - braille
              - speech
              - symbols
              - simpler language
            
            - content types (potentially) not available in other forms and how to adapt them
              - controls/input: [must have a name attribute to describe its purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name)
              - [time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#time-based-media): at least provide descriptive identification of the content
              - test or exercise: if unable to provide a text alternative, at least provide a descriptive identificatoin of the non-text content
              - [sensory experiences](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-specific-sensory-experience): text alternatives provide descriptive identification of the non-text content
              - CAPTCHA: if the purpose it so confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer (i.e. a normal fkn captcha),  text alternatives should identify and describe the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of captcha using different types of sensory perception are provided to accomodate different disabilities
              - Decoration, formatting, invisible: if non-text content is pure decoration, used only for visual formatting/not presented t users. then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology
        
        - operable:
        
        - understandable:
        
        - robust:
      
      2. guidelines: 13 guidelines provide the basic goals in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities 
      
      3. success criteria: for each of the 13 guidelines, exist *testable success criteria* for *requirements* and *conformance* **testing** 
         - design specification
         - purchasing 
         - regulation
         - contractual agreements 
         - conformance levels: rough thresholds to assess how well web content meet the success levels
           - A: lowest success 
           - AA: medium success
           - AAA: the gold standard!
      
      4. sufficient and advisory techniques: for each *guideline* and *success criteria* a number of techniques are documented.
         - techniques sufficient for *meeting* success crtieria
         - techniques sufficient for *meeting* and **go beyond** (these are *advisory techniques*)
    
    - WCAG versions 
      - each version *builds on* and *meets* the guidelines set by the previous version
      - thus 2.2 meets and expands on 2.1, which does the same for 2.0, etc
