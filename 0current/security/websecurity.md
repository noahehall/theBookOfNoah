### terminology

- exploit: a piece of code that illustrates how to take advantage of a secuirty flaw
- 0 day: type of exploit that has be publicized for less than a day/not publicized at all
- white hat: discovery security holes and will advise owners of the exploits before making them public
- black hat: hoard exploits to maximize the time windows during which they can use vulnerabilities
- dark web: websites available oly via special network nodes that anonymize incoming IP address

- ICANN: internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
  - alotts blocks of IP addresses to regional authorities
- regional authorities
  - grant blocks of addresses to internet service prviders and hosting companies within their region
  - when you connect to the net, your ISP assigned an IP to your computer
    - however the IP is rotated periodically
  - similary: companies that host content are assigned an IP for each server they connect to the network

#### internet protocol suite

- internet protocol suite: dictates how computers exchange data over the web
  - there are over 20 protocols collectively under this umbrella

- TCP: transmission control protocol
  - created in response to ARPANET (predecessor to the internet)
  - the first msg sent (was on ARPANET) was a LOGIN command destined for a remote computer at stanford university, but crashed after the first two letters (reason for TCP)

  - high level workflow
    - messages sent via TCP are split into data packets
    - the servers that make up the internet push these packets from sender to receiver without having to read the entire msg
    - the receiver reassembles all the data packets into a usable order according to the sequence number on each packet
      - each packet the receiver gets, it responds with a receipt back to the sender
      - without the receipt, the sender will resend the packet
        - possibly along a different network path
        - possibly at an adjusted speed based on the speed of consumption by receiver
    - this send & receipt workflow guarantees msg delivery

- UDP: User Dataram Protocol
  - commonly used with video/situations where dropped data packets are expected/msg guarantee isnt required, but the data packets can be streamed at a constant rate

- IP: internet protocol addresses
  - destination for data packets
  - unique binary numbers assigned to individual internet-connected computers
  - IPv4: 2x32 addresses
  - IPv6: represented as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by colons
