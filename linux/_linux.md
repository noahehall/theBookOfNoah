# NEW: need to file
## bash
  - run multiple commands: cm1; cm2; etc
  - 
## ubuntu
	- store web content in /var/www
	- create user, group, and directory for user that will run some daemon application
		+ redis example:
			1. sudo adduser --system --group --no-create-home redis
			2. sudo mkdir /var/lib/redis
			3. sudo chown redis:redis /var/lib/redis
			4. sudo chmod 770 /var/lib/redis
	- [use tmpfs to store files/directories in memory](https://www.howtoforge.com/storing-files-directories-in-memory-with-tmpfs)

need to file
    Add your Node.js start script to the file you edited for port redirection, /etc/rc.local. That will run your Node.js launch script when the system starts.

	add user to sudo group
		adduser USERNAME sudo
	linux notes
			get a folders path:
					click and drag into terminal. dope!

			cron grabs pdf every X and sends email

			install xvfb to run wkhtmltopdf from cron
				> Debian.

				I see.  Im changing this to a wishlist bug to make wkhtmltopdf run
				without an X server eventually.  Even if it never happens, this bug
				report can serve as a pointer to the following workaround:

				If you install the "xvfb" package, you can use the xvfb-run script like
				this, without a real X server running:

				  $ xvfb-run wkhtmltopdf ...

## basic commands
	- vi filename #open file
	- :q #exit when there are no changes
	- :q! #exit without saving changes
	-	:wq #exit and save
	- `esc` #finish input to current command

## text commands

# customize your environment
	- bash initialization for login
		- only runs on first login
		- /etc/profile 
  		- default commands all users get
		- ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.profile, ~/.login 
  		- personal customizations per user,
			- the first file found will be used
	
	- bash initialization for subshells
		- runs after login, e.g. if you open up multiple shells
		- ~/.bashrc
			- whats available in bash_profile, is not available in bashrc
	- bash logout customizations
		~/.bash_logout #commands that run on user logout
	
	- command aliases
		- alias 
  		- returns all of your aliases
		- alias blah='add this aliased command for this session only'
		- echo "alias blah='add this aliased command permentantly com'" >> .bashrc
	- source filename
		- Execute commands from a file in the current shell.
		- useful to reload files, eg. .bashrc, without having to login and out of shell
	- environment (i.e. shell) variables
		- BOOM='pow' #set a temporary variable
		- echo 'BOOM="pow"' >> .bashrc #set a permanent variable
		- $BOOM #retrieve the value from a variable
		- export variables for use in child processes, scripts, programs, etc
			- in .bashrc
				- in two lines
					- BOOM='pow'
					- export BOOM
				- in one line
					- export BOOM='pow'
		- you can also set command specific variables and default configuration that each command will always use
			- e.g. with history
				- export HISTSIZE=10000 #default is 500
				- export HISTFILESIZE=1000000
				- export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%b %d %I:%M %p ' #using strftime format
				- export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth #ignoredups:ignorespace
					- Unknown:0 dont record the same line multiple times
					- Unknown:20 dont record any line that begins with a space
						- if you enter a command and start the line with the space, the history wont save the command but unix will still run the command
						- useful for hiding sensitive information
				- export HISTIGNORE="history:pwd:exit:df:ls:ls:which:whatis:info:whereis:help"
					- ignore specific commands
		- customize command prompt
			#the beginning line of text in shell
			PS1="FAME " #the cmd prompt will start with FAME
			PS1="\u " #use your username
				options
					\u : your username
					\s : current SHELL
					\w : current working directory
					\W : basename of current workign directory
					\d : date in weekday month date
					\A : time in 24 hour format HH:MM format
					\t : time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
					\@ : time in 12-hour HH:MM am/pm format
					\T : time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
					\H : hostname
					\h : hostname up to first "."
					\! : history number of this command
					\$ : when UID is 0 (root), a '#', otherwise a "$"
					\\ : literal backslash

		add load .bashrc in .bash_profile
			1. edit your .bash_profile
				if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
					source ~/.bashrc
				fi
					#if ~/.bashrc exists, load it
			2. now you should put all of your configurations in .bashrc

	networking using DHCP {
		DHCP is a dynamic IP address that can change on reboot
		check if you have internet connectivity
			ping some.random.ip
				ping 8.8.8.8

				it will return a # of bytes (if success)
				or 'unreachable' if not (might be do to firewall)

			ctrl c
				quit the ping and receive summary
		network configuration files
			/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
				has a file for each interface

				ifcfg-enXXXX #network configuration file
					this is an ethernet interface file, edit it

					type = should be "Ethernet"
					BOOTPROTO = should be "dhcp"
					ONBOOT = should be "yes"
	}

	using a static IP address {
		find your installed ethernet cards
			nmcli d

			nmtui

		manually install host only network adapter for virtualbox
			https://ftanada.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/virtualbox-host-only-ethernet-adapter-not-working-in-windows-8-1/

		static IP address does not change
		ways to do it
			1. setup a DHCP reservation using the MAC adddress
			2. set a static IP explicityly on the server

		using #2
			1. edit your network configuration file
				cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
				nano ifcfg-eno1
					it could be ifcfg-enp0s3
			2. change your BOOTPROTO from dhcp to static
			3. ensure ONBOOT is set to yes
			4. add:
				IPADDR=192.168.1.201
				the IPADDR should be outside your networks DHCP range
				NETMASK=255.255.255.0
				GATEWAY=enter the IP address of your router
					open cmd, ipconfig
					default gateway = your router ip
				DNS1=8.8.8.8
					#googles public DNS server
					you can add DNS2, DNS3, etc. to various dns servers
			5. restart your network
				service network restart

		log in with SSH (mac/gitbash)
			ssh root@ip.add.of.remote

		exit
			exit the ssh session

		connect to a virtual machine via SSH with virtual box
			1. get ip address of virtual machine #ip a
			2. go into settings > network and add port forwarding rule
			3. host ip = 127.0.0.1 #local hosts for your comp
			4. host port = 2222
			5. guest IP = your vbox IP from step 1

	standard access control mechanisms {
		Standard LInux: discretionary access control (DAC)
			users, groups, permissions
		SELinux: Mandatory access control (MAC)
			labels resources for more granular access control
			provides access control secuirty policies for linux
			tags every file and resource for granular security
			sets security contexts on files
			processes inherit permissions from the user who starts it up
			adheres to the principle of Least Privilege

		SELinux states:
			enforcing: enforces SELinux policies
			permissive:	only logs policy exceptions to /var/log/audit/audit_log
			disabled: SELinux doesnt participate in system security

		SELinux policies: only in enforcing & permissive states
			strict: all activity is subject to SELinux
			targeted: only enforced on specific processes:
				e.g. httpd, named, ntpd, snmpd, etc

		SELinux access control levels:
			determines whether an action is permitted

			Type Enforcement: TE
			Role-Based Access Control: RBAC
			Multi-Level Security:MLS

		SELinux locations
			/etc/sysconfig/selinux #file controls selinux

		SELinux commands
			sestatus #see the current status
			ls -Z #shows the security context of the current folder
				unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0
					unconfined_u: user context
						unconfined = not protected under SELinux
					object_r: role context
					user_home_t: type context
					s0: MLS context (multi-level security)
			ls -Z /some/folder #same thing but for a specific folder
			ps axZ #check the security context for a service
				if a processs type context does not match the type
				>context of the file its trying to access AND there
				>are policies in enforcing the context
				>the service wont be able to access the file
			setenforce 0 #sets enforcing to permissive until reboot
			setenforce 1 #sets enforcing to target until reboot
			chcon #change context of files & folders
				chcon -R -t contexthere /path/to/dir
