  - The purpose of the make utility is to determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.
  - you can use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.
  - You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
  - To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.
  - In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.
