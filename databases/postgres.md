# research
  - User-defined types
  - Table inheritance
  - Sophisticated locking mechanism
  - Foreign key referential integrity
  - Views, rules, subquery
  - Nested transactions (savepoints)
  -
  - Asynchronous replication
  - Tablespaces
  - Point-in-time recovery

# terminology
  - PostgreSQL: general purpose and object-relational database management system, the most advanced open source database system
    - allows you to add custom functions developed using different programming
    - define your own data types, index types, functional languages, etc.
    - develop a custom plugin to enhance it to meet your requirements e.g., adding a new optimizer.
  - Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC):
    - known as snapshot isolation in Oracle

# server and db objects
  - server service: You can install multiple PostgreSQL servers on a physical server using different ports and having different locations to store data.
  - database: container of other objects such as tables, views, functions, indexes, etc
  - table: used to store the data
  - table inheritance: a table (child table) can inherit from another table (parent table) so when you query data from the child table, the data from parent table is also showing up.
  - schema: logical container of tables and other objects inside a database.
    - Each PostgreSQL database may have multiple schemas.
  - tablespace:  where PostgreSQL stores the data
    - enables you to move your data to different physical location across drivers easily by using simple commands.
    - pg_default: for storing userâ€™s data
    - pg_global: for storing system data.
  - view: a virtual table that is used to simplify complex queries and to apply security for a set of records.
    - updatable views:
  - function:  a block reusable SQL code that returns a scalar value of a list of records
  - operator:  a symbolic function.
  - cast: enable you to convert one data type into another data type.
    - You can also create your own casts to override the default casting provided by PostgreSQL.
  - sequence:  used to manage auto-increment columns that defined in a table as a serial column.
  - extension:  wrap other objects including types, casts, indexes, functions, etc into a single unit.
    -  The purpose of extensions is to make it easier to maintain.
  - subquery: a query nested inside another query, e.g. in the where clause with the in operator

# installing on buntu 18.04
  - install commands
    ```sql
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    ```
  - post install
    - installation process creates a user account called `postgres` that is associated wiht the default postgres role
      - in order to use postgres, you can log into that account
      ```sql
        -- option 1: switch over to postgres account via intermediary bash shell
          sudo -i -u postgres -- switch to postgres linux user
          psql -- access postgres prompt
          \q -- exit out of postgresql prompt

        -- include flag E
          sudo -i -u postgres psql -E
        -- option 2: accessing postgres prompt without switching accounts via sudo
          sudo -u postgres psql

      -- setup formatting so responses fit to the width of the screen

## roles/users
  - roles: handle authentication and authorization
    - similar to unix-style accounts
    - roles do not distinguish between users and groups
      - roles: users that cannot login
      - users: roles with LOGIN permission
    - can be members of other roles, allowing them to take on the permission characteristics of previously defined roles.
    - can also own objects and control access to those object for other roles.

  ```sql
    -- creating a new user (same as role) from the CLI
      -- if logged in as postgres account
        createuser --interactive
      -- if current user has sudo access
        sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive
    -- create a role from psql prompt
      CREATE ROLE new_role_name WITH permission_name;
      CREATE ROLE new_role_name WITH LOGIN; -- same as creating a user
      CREATE USER role_name; --creates a role with login permission

    -- alter roles
      ALTER ROLE role_name WITH permissions


    -- DELETE roles
      DROP ROLE role_name; --errors if role does not exist
      DROP ROLE IF EXISTS role_name;

    -- roles
      \du --view roles
      \h CREATE ROLE -- view role permissions
        --   SUPERUSER | NOSUPERUSER
        -- | CREATEDB | NOCREATEDB
        -- | CREATEROLE | NOCREATEROLE
        -- | INHERIT | NOINHERIT
        --
        -- | LOGIN | NOLOGIN
        -- | REPLICATION | NOREPLICATION
        -- | BYPASSRLS | NOBYPASSRLS
        -- | CONNECTION LIMIT connlimit
        -- | [ ENCRYPTED ] PASSWORD 'password'
        -- | VALID UNTIL 'timestamp'
        -- | IN ROLE role_name [, ...]
        -- | IN GROUP role_name [, ...]
        --
        -- | ROLE role_name [, ...]
        -- | ADMIN role_name [, ...]
        -- | USER role_name [, ...]
        -- | SYSID uid
  ```
## permissions
  - hen a database or table is created, usually only the role that created it (not including roles with superuser status) has permission to modify it.
  ```sql
    -- grant permission to role for a table
      GRANT permission_type ON table_name TO role_name;

    -- grant one role member of another role
      GRANT some_role TO member_of_this_role;

    -- issue commands as a role you are member of
      SET ROLE role_im_member_of;

    -- automatically have all permissions of all roles you are member of
      ALTER ROLE some_role INHERIT;

    -- reset role to original permissions
      RESET ROLE;

    -- grant full permissions to user
      GRANT ALL ON table_name TO role_name;

    -- grant permissions for every user on system
      GRANT INSERT ON table_name TO PUBLIC;

    -- remove permissions
      REVOKE permission_type ON table_name FROM user_name;

    -- remove all public/super-user permissions from table
      REVOKE INSERT ON table_name FROM PUBLIC|ALL;



    -- view all grant table (all granted permissions)
      \z
  ```
## Authentication
  - types of authentication
    - ident: associates postgres roles with a matching unix/linux system account
      - if a role exists within postgress, a unix/linux username with the same name is able to sign in as that role
      - Another assumption that the Postgres authentication system makes by default is that for any role used to log in, that role will have a database with the same name which it can access.
    - accessing database
      - Logging in
        - users are only allowed to login locally if the system username matches the PostgreSQL username.
          - an get around this by either:
            - changing the login type
            - or by specifying that PostgreSQL should use the loopback network interface, which would change the connection type to remote, even though it is actually a local connection.
  ```sql
    -- login with username and pass to a specific DB and IP
      psql -U user_name -d database_name -h 127.0.0.1 -W

    -- passwords
      \password test_user
  ```



## databases and tables
  ```sql
    -- create a table
      CREATE TABLE demo (
        name varchar(25),
        id serial,
        start_date date
      );

    -- change ownership of table to another role
      ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO role_name;

    -- view table relations/ownership
      \d

  ```
# statements
## select
  - Select distinct rows by using `DISTINCT` operator.
  - Filter rows by using `WHERE` clause.
  - Sort rows by using `ORDER` BY clause.
  - Select rows based on various operators such as `BETWEEN`, `IN` and `LIKE`.
  - Group rows into groups using `GROUP BY` clause
  - Apply conditions for groups using `HAVING` clause.
  - Join a table to other tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN` clauses.
  - To construct a subquery, we put the second query in brackets and use it in the WHERE clause as an expression

### retrieval
  ```sql
    -- basic retrieval
      select * from tablename;
      select col1, col2 from tablename;
      select distint col1 from tablename;
      select distinct col1, col2 from tablename; -- distinct applies to combination of column values
      select distinct on (col1) col2 from tablename order by col1; -- returns first distinct value of each group. order by col must be the distinct on col. the distinct on col value is not returned but you can list it twice
      select distinct on (col1) col1, col2 from tablename order by col1;
      select * from tablename order by col asc|desc;

    -- filtering
      -- basic structure
        select * from tablename where CONDITIONS order by col limit N offset M
          --limit = max records
          --order by = must be used whenever using LIMIT
          --offset = skip X records before selecting
      -- common conditions
        col1 = 'some string' and col2 = 'other thing';
        col1 is null;
        col1 is not null
        col1 NOT BETWEEN low AND high;
        col1 < low OR value > high; -- same as above
        col1 between lowvalue and highvalue;
        col1 >= lowvalue and col1 <= highvalue; --same as above
        col <= 1 or col >= 0;
        col1 in (this, list, of, values)
        col1 not in (this, list, of, values)
        col1 <> (same, as, above)
        col in (select colX from tablename)
      -- common pattern matching conditions
        col like 'blah%'; -- % match any sequence of characters
        col like 'bl_h'; -- match any single character
        col not like 'bl_h';
        first_name LIKE '_her%';
          'foo' LIKE 'foo'; -- true
          'foo' LIKE 'f%'; -- true
          'foo' LIKE '_o_'; -- true
          'bar' LIKE 'b_'; -- false
        first_name ILIKE 'BAR%'; -- case insensitive
  ```

### builtin functions
  ```sql
    select avg (col) from tablename;
  ```

### sub queries
  - First, executes the subquery.
  - Second, gets the result and passes it to the outer query.
  - Third, executes the outer query.
  ```sql
    -- basic subquery
      select * from tablename where col > (
        select avg (col2) from othertablename
      );

    -- retrieve rows that return true via the exist operator
      select * from tablename where exists (
        select 1 from tablename where CONDITIONS
      );
  ```

# tables
  - temporary table: exists for the duration of a db session
## creating and modifying
  - primary key: field(s) used to uniquely identify a record
    - default name is tablename_pk
    - Technically, a primary key constraint is the combination of a not-null constraint and a UNIQUE constraint.
    - A table can have one and only one primary key.
    - good practice to add a primary key to every table.
  - foreign key: field(s) in one table record that uniquely identify the primary key of a record in another table
    - default name is tablename__colname_fk
    - referencing/child table: the table that contains the foreign key
    - referenced/parent table: the table whose primary key is referenced by the child table
    - a foreign key constraint maintains referential integrity between child and parent tables
  - column keywords:
    - primary key (col1, colX)
      - can be one/more columns
    - not null
  - data types: serial, numeric, int,
    - character
      - char(n) - fixed length blank padded
      - varchar(n) variable length
      - text
        - text has unlimited length
    - numeric:
      - integers
        - smallint int serial
          - int4 | int8
            - research this
          - serial is auto generated & incremented
      - floating point
        - float(n) real float8 numeric numeric(p,s)
          - float(n) where n = number of decimal places
          - numeric(p,s)
            - p = number of digits before the decimal
            - s = number of digits after the decimal
    - temporal/time
      - date time timestamp timestampz interval
        - timestampz = stores both timestamp and timezone
        - interval = periods of time
    - bool:
      - truthy: true, t, yes, y, 1
      - falsy: false, f, no, n, 0
    - arrays: array of other data types, e.g. for storing days of week
    - json: plain json data that requires reparsing later on
    - jsonb: json in binary format for faster processing but slower insert
      - supports indexing
    - uuid: store uuid values defined by RFC 4122
      - guarantee a better uniqueness than serial
      - can be used to hide sensitive data
    - box: rectangular box
    - line: a set of points
    - point: geometric pair of numbers
    - lseg: line segment
    - polygon: closed geometric
    - inet: ip4 address
    - macaddr: a mac address
  ```sql
    create table tablename (
      col1 TYPE keyword1 keyword2 keywordX,
      col2 etc,
      col3 primary key, -- default name is tablename_pk
      constraint NAME primary key(col4) -- give the pkey a name
      colX etc,
      foreign key(col1) references othertablename(colid) -- this gives the foreign key a name
      col3 TYPE references othertablename(colid2) -- references keyword defines the foreign key constraint, doesnt give the foreign key a name
      col4 type references othertablename(colid3) ON DELETE RESTRICT -- the parent table record will not be deleted until all references are deleted
      col5 type references othertablename(colid4) ON DELETE CASCADE -- all child records are deleted if the parent record is deleted
      FOREIGN KEY (c2, c3) REFERENCES parent_table (p1, p2) -- group of columns as foreign keys
      unique(col2)
      unique(col3, col4) --unique combination
    );

    -- add primary key to a table without one
      alter table tablename add primary key (colX)
    -- add auto incremented primary key
      alter table tablename add column colx serial primary key
    -- remove primary key
      alter table tablename drop constraint pkname

    -- add foreign key constraint to existing table
      ALTER TABLE child_table ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name
        FOREIGN KEY (c1) REFERENCES parent_table (p1);

    -- remove a constraint from a table
      ALTER TABLE child_table DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_fkey;
    -- add index based on two columns
      create index indexname on tablename(col1, col2)
    -- add unique index to col1 to table and name the index indexname
      create unique index concurrently indexname
        on tablename (col1)
    -- add a unique constraint to a table using an index name
      alter table tablename
        add constrain contraintname
        unique using index indexname;

    -- create a table with the same schema as another
      create table tablename (like othertablename)

    -- add column to existing table
      alter table tablename add column col1 type;
    -- set default value for column
      alter table tablename alter column col1 set default value
    -- rename column
      ALTER TABLE table_name
      RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_column_name;


  ```
## deleting tables
  ```sql
    drop table tablename
    drop table if exists tablename -- dont throw error if table doesnt exist
    drop table cascade -- drop and remove all dependent objects (views, references, etc)
    drop table restrict -- dont drop if any references exist
  ```
# updating records
  - 'upsert: update if it exists, else inserts it'
  ```sql
    insert into tablename (col1, colX)
    values
      (col1Value, colXValue),
      (col1Value, colXValue),
      (col1Value, default); -- use the default value for the column

    -- insert and return some cols value e.g. its id
      insert into tablename (col1, colX)
        values(val1, valx)
        returning id

    -- insert rows from another table
      insert into tablename (col1, colX)
      select col2, col3
      from othertablename where CONDITIONS

    -- updating
      update tablename set col1 = val1, colX = valX where CONDITION;
        set col1 = col2 - col3 * col3
    -- update all by not using where clause
      update tablename set col1 = val1;
    -- update one table with values from another table
      update tablename set col1 = othertablename.col1
        from othertablename
        where tablename.id = othertablename.id

    -- upserting
      insert into tablename(col1, colX)
        values(val1, valX)
        on conflict target action
          -- targets
            on (col1)
            on constraint constraintname
            on a where clause with a predicate -- research this
          -- actions
            do nothing -- do nothing if row already exists
            do update set col1 = val1 where CONDITION -- update fields with these values on conflict
    -- upsert: do nothing example
      insert into ... values ...
        on conflict on constraint constraintname
        do nothing

  ```

# deleting records
  - truncate: remove all data from a large table
    - does not remove any child tables unless you specify `cascade`
  - delete: scans the table before deleting records (usually because of where clause)
  ```sql
    delete from tablename where CONDITION
    -- delete based on values from othertablename
      delete from tablename
        using othertablename
        where tablename.id = othertablename.id
      delete from tablename where tablename.id = (
        select id from othertablename
      ) -- same as above
    -- delete all records from tablename
      delete from tablename;

    -- truncate table
      truncate table tablename1, tablename2
    -- truncate and remove reset sequence generator
      truncate table tablename reset identity
    -- truncate table and remove records from all child tables if any
      truncate table tablename cascade

  ```
# prepared statements
  ```sql
    -- create a prepared statement that accepts an argument
      prepare statementname(arg1)
        as select * from tablename where col1 = $1 -- $1 = arg1
