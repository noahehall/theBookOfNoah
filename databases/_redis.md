# terminology 
    - messaging systems
        - permits communication between processes using different queues
        - one process sends a message to a queue, and another process(s) can listen for messages in a given queue 


# use cases 
    - redis can act like a database, cache, or message broker
    - data is stored in RAM, thus i/o is lightspeed relative to disk

# admin 
```sh 
  # admin
    sudo systemctl start|restart|poop redis-server
    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
    redis-cli # tty 
    redis-cli monitor # see all logs in a new shell
    shutdown # shutdown server
    exit 
    quit
    client list #get list of all connected clients

  # dbs
    flushdb #delete all records from your current db
    flushall #delete all records from all dbs
    


```



# commands
## authentication
  1. open redis.conf
  2. uncomment the line beginnning with # requirepass
  3. set the master password

## admin
  - sudo service redis-server start|stop|restart
  - redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf #start
    - Config file    : /etc/redis/6379.conf


## [DATA TYPES](https://redis.io/topics/data-types)
  - [string](https://redis.io/commands/#string)
  - [hashes](https://redis.io/commands/#hash)
  - [lists](https://redis.io/commands/#list): array of ordered and possibly duplicated values
  - [sets](https://redis.io/commands/#set): array of unordered unique values
  - [sorted sets](https://redis.io/commands/#sorted_set): array of unique values sorted by score

### use cases 
    - strings 
        - can contain any data type, are binary safe, max length of 512mb
        - session cache 
            - caching html fragments/pages
            - store online store cart info so buyers dont lose their info on login/out/interruptions/etc
        - queues 
            - any app dealing with traffic congestion, messaging, data gathering, job management, routing, etc
            - manage que size by rate of arrival and departure for resource distributionn 
        - usage and mtered billing
            - realtime metering for consumption-based pricing models
                - e.g. platforms that bill based on usage to meter their customers activity, e.g. per textmsg/minute    
    - lists 
        - contain strings that are sorted by insertion order 
        - queues
            - add priority items to head, other items to tail 
        - event data
            - when knowing the order of events are important,
                - e.g. social media sites timelines/feeds
            - customize ordered lists with most important at top
        - ranked data 
            - e.g. leaderboards, thumbs up/down tracking, etc
    - regular sets
        - support intersection and unions
            - do not allow duplicate keys/members
            - regardless of the number of elements stored in a set, will take the same time to add/rmeove items 
        - whenever you want to perform an audit and see relationships between various variables 
        - scheduling jobs (e.g. cron|other background tasks)
        - analyze ecommerce sales and arbitrary relationship management
            - unions, intersections, subtractions (venn diagrams) to understand custom behavior
            - e.g. patterns between geneders, products, hours of purchases (intersection)
        - ip address tracking 
            - analyze ip addresses that visited a specific site/post/etc (ignore the duplicates automatically with sets)
        - inappropriate content filtering 
            - basically add bad words to a set, and quickly determine if some TEXT conteains any words in the set
    - sorted sets 
        - collection of weighted (i.e. score) strings 
        - Q&A platforms 
            - rank the highested voted answers for each proposed question
        - gaming app scoreboards 
            - gaming apps high score lists
                - scores can be repeataed, but the strings which contain the user details cannot 
        - task scheduling service 
            - rank the priority of tasks in a queue 
        - geo hashing 
            - index locations based on latitude and longtitude
                - turns multi dimensional data into linear data
    - hashes 
        - maps string fields to string values 
            - containers of unique fields to values
        - user profiles 
        - user posts 
            - map user photos/posts back to asingle user 
        - multi-tenant metrics 
            - record and store product/sales metrics in a that that guarnatees solid separation between each tenant

# [pubsub]((https://redis.io/commands/#pubsub))
    - system to subscribe to channels, and publish to channels
    - architecture 
        - subscribers: clients whom subscribe to channel(s)
            - when subscribing using glob style, you may receive the same message multiple times
            - channels are auto deleted if no one is ubscribed
    - publishers: clients whom publish to channel(s)
  
    - best practices 
        - prefix your channels with stuff 
          - news.blah.hello 
          - testing.blah.hello


```sh
    # subscribing to stuff
        # listen to/create 2 channels
            subscribe channelA channelX
        # subscribe to all existing and future channels that begin with blah
            psubscribe blah* 
        # leave all all channels 
            UNSUBSCRIBE 
        # leave channelName
            unsubscribe channelName
        # leave all channels starting with blah. 
            PUNSUBSCRIBE blah.*

    # posting msgs
        # post a msg to chnnelName
            PUBLISH channelName msg

    # other 
        # publish and subscribe to all channels
            pubsub

# [transactions](https://redis.io/commands/#transactions)
  - usecases
    + insert multiple values that rely on each other
## commands
  - MULTI #starts a transaction
    + all commands sent to redis must succeed or none of them will persist
    + all commands are queued, until you close the transaction
  - EXEC # executes all queued commands in the transaction
    + if any errors occurred since the transaction started, none of the commands will persist
  - DISCARD # delete all queued commands and close the transaction
