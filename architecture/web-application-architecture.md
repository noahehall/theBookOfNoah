# web application architecture
  - varies greatly depending on the application at hand
  - defines the interactions between applications, middleware systems and databases to ensure multiple applications can work together
  - defines precisely how an application will function, as each architecture has different ways of doing things
  - includes all subcomponents and external application interchanges for an entire software appplication
  - impacts the software life cycle
    - specification of requirements
    - design of services
    - acquisition and outsourcing
    - asset management
  - 3 main types
    - single page applications
    - microservices
    - serverless architectures
  - concerns
    - user requirements
      - usability
    - developer requirements
      - performance
      - scalability
      - development speed
    - software product owner requirements
      - hardware
      - maintenance
      - network infrastructure
      - security

## components
### scalability
 - desirable poroperty of a system which indicates its ability to handle growing amounts of work in a graceful manner, or to be enlarged as demands increase
 - 7 stages
   1. simple architecture
     - firewall and load balancer
     - pair of web servers
     - database server
     - internal storage
     - use cases
       - low complexity, quick development and lots of features fast
       - no redundancy, low operational cost great for startups
   2. grow bigger
     1. add redundant firewalls, load balancers
     - more web servers for performance
     - add database redundancy


  - DNS
  - web browsers
  - CDN
    - content delivery network
    - provides a way of serving static assets
  - load balancing
  - storage
  - web app servers
    - execute the core business logic for responding to requests
  - database servers
  - job queue & servers
    - responsible for doing work asynchronously behind the scenes thats not directly associated with responding to a users request
  - services
    - authentication
    - authorization
    - payments
    - etc
  - caching service
    - simple key/value data store that makes it possible to save and lookup information closer to requests
  - deployment & release management
  - change management
### application performance management
  - the monitoring and management of performance and availability of software applications
  - strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintan an expected level of service
  - the translation of IT metrics into business meetings
  - performance metrics
    - performance experienced by end users of the application
      - load
        - the volume of transactions proccessed by the application without being loaded by computer-based demands for searches, calculations etc
          - Transactions per second
          - requests per second
          - page per second
      - response times
        - the times required for an application to respond to a users actions at such a load
    - computational resources  used by the application for the load,
      - indicates whether there is adequate capacity to support the load
      - possible locations of performance bottlenecks
      - establishes an empirical performance basline for the application
        - the baseline can be used to detect changes in performance
  - conceptual framework
    - end user experience
      - measuring the transit of traffic from user request to data and back is part of capturing the end user experience
        - real time application monitoring
          - aka top down monitoring
          - passive monitoring
            - an agentless appliance implemented using network port mirroring
          - active monitoring
            - synthetic probes and web robots predefined to report system availability and business transactions
    - runtime application architecture
      - application discovery and dependency mapping exist to automate the process of mapping transactions and applications to underlying infrastructure components
    - business transaction management
      - focus on user-defined transactions/url page definitions that have meaing to the business community
    - component monitoring
      - generally targeted at middleware focusing on web, application and messaging servers
      - provides a real-time view of stacks, tying them back to user defined business transactions
    - analytics/reporting
      - a common set of metrics to collect and report on for each application
      - standardize common views on how to present the application performance data
      -
### UI/UX
  - related to user interface/experience rather than the development

### structural
  - web browser/client
    - the interface rendition of a web app functionality which the user interacts with
    - i.e. the content delivered to the client
  - server
    - application server
      - business logic
      - multi-layer applications
        - each layer represents a logical separation within the application
        - tiers
          - when the application logical is physically distributed to separate servers/processes
        - manage complexity by breaking up the application according to its responsibilities/concerns
        - common low-level functionality can be reused throughout the application
        - enforce restrictions on which layers can community with other layers
          - helps to achieve encapsulation
        - logical layering
          - common technique for impr
    - database server
      - provides and stores data
      - supports business logic
      -

# architecture types
## N-layer  architectures
  - user interface
  - business logic
  - data access

        - common specifications, policies, etc should be made at the bus level, rather than for each individual service
        - facilitates the implementation of common, lower level business infrastructure services that can be aggregated into other higher llevel business services on the same bus
          - e.g. they could all use the same product code validation
        - each business domain deveopes a vocabulary and business model of both process and object
        - services on a bus should all
          - follow the same semantic standards

## repository pattern
  - mediates between th domain and mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects
  - provides an abstraction of data so that your application can work with an interface approximating that of a collection
  - CRUD actions on a collection is done through a series of methods, without the need to deal with database concerns (connections, cmds, etc)
  - repository per entity/busines object
    - simplest approach (Especially with an existing system)
    - create a new repository for each object you need to store/retrieve from your persisten layer
    - should only implement the specific methods you are calling in your application
  - generic repository interface
    - simple genereic interface for the repository
    - setup constraints
  - generic repository implementation
    - implement the interface generically so that you can create repositories for any given type


## specification pattern
  - describes a query in an object
    - e.g. to encapsulate a paged query that searches for some products
      - create a PagedProduct specification which takes in necessary parameters
      - one of your repository methods would accept execute the specification object to retrieve the results
