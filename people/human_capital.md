    - business to business
      - generalist firms operating in the fields of human resources, recruitment and organizational strategy have entered what they perceive as a growing market,[6] not to mention smaller firms and self-employed professionals who provide consulting, training and coaching.
    - consumer to business
      - a business model in which consumers (individuals) create value and businesses consume that value
      - when a consumer writes reviews or when a consumer gives a useful idea for new product development then that consumer is creating value for the business if the business adopts the input.

  - Any sort of development — whether economic, political, biological, organisational or personal—requires a framework if one wishes to know whether a change has actually occurred.
    - Goals or benchmarks that define the end-points
    - Strategies or plans for reaching goals
    - Measurement and assessment of progress, levels or stages that define milestones along a development path
    - A feedback system to provide information on changes
  - Research on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by Albert Bandura (born 1925), suggested that self-efficacy[19] best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results
    - According to Bandura self-confidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because:[20]
      - it makes you expect to succeed
      - it allows you take risks and set challenging goals
      - it helps you keep trying if at first you don't succeed
      - it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough
  - Martin Seligman roposed a new focus: on healthy individuals[citation needed] rather than on pathology (he created the "positive psychology" current)
    - a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against mental illness
      - courage, optimism, interpersonal skill, work ethic, hope, honesty and perseverance
  - Arthur Chickering defined seven vectors of personal development[23] for young adults during their undergraduate years:
    - developing competence
    - managing emotions
    - achieving autonomy and interdependence
    - developing mature interpersonal relationships
    - establishing identity
    - developing purpose
    - developing integrity
  - Steve Salerno
    - uses the acronym SHAM: The Self-Help and Actualization Movement—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful
    - Others similarly point out that with self-help books 'supply increases the demand...The more people read them, the more they think they need them...more like an addiction than an alliance
