# TIPS AND TRICKS AND BEST PRACTICES
## Best Practices
  - generally a good practice to have some throttling when testing sites. Itll help you see your sites performance from your users perspectives.
  - wrap next level JS in feature detection logic 'for' progressive enhancment
    if (this.next.level.shit) run it
  - javascript doesnt have private methods,  but methods that should be private should be indicated with an underscore in the name if they are only called by a specific object
  - OFFLINE FIRST (all child of window less otherwise stated)
    + online first: we try the network first, if it doesnt, we show some fallback content (or 404 page)
    + offline first:
        1. full content: deliver page header + content from cache, then update via network request
          .update cache on SW install
          .strategy for unobtrusive app updates
          .get the user onto latest version
          .continually update cache of posts
          .selectively cache everything you want available offline (e.g. images, posts, etc.)
        2. header first: deliver page header from cache, attempt to retrieve content via network request, then fall back to cached content on device
    + anything in this file stemming from window... (e.g. document, navigator, etc.) is happening in a page/document
    + cache photos/media instead of storing them in db.
      db: read data > convert to blob > store it. loses streaming capabilities
      cache: request data > streams back > and can display it as it arrives (i.e. piece by piece)
  - browser requests
    1. request > http cache (found?) return page
    2. else > go to internet > retrieve html>
    3. other stuff needed ? > request css & javascript
## Accessibility:
  - Accessible: everyone can access the site's content and use it's functionality functionality
    + for users who are experiencing some time of impairment
    + the sites' content should be available to everyone
    + the sites' functionality can be operated by anyone
    + examples: events
### Accessibility users
  - visually impaired (color, near sited, far sited, braile)
    + use braile readers, text to speach, magnification (zoomed in), keyboard navigation, color contrast plugins
  - hearing impaired
  - motor
    + use hand/eye tracking software, voice dictation
  - cognitive (understanding, memory, etc) issues
  - Impairments can be:
    1. permanent
    2. temporary
    3. situational
### Accessibility technologies
  - screen readers: reads the text on the screen
  - braile keyboards: useful for blind people
### Accessibility environments:
  - desktop
  - mobile
  - screen readers
  - tablets
### Accessibility Best Practices
  + (WCAG): [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
    - [AIM Checklist](http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)
    - POUR Guidelines
      1. Perceivable: users can perceive content
      2. Operable: users can navigate
      3. Understandable: users can understand the content and interface and avoid confusion
      4. Robust: can a wide variety of agents consume the data
  + functionality
    - keyboard navigation
    - shortcut keys
  + Style and visual design:
    - text color should be high contrast with background color for readability (sight)
    - should be minimal to help with understanding the page
    - check your design patterns against aria: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/
  + Forms:
    - Inputs and labels should be close enough together for understanding the relation between the two
      + if they are two far apart, you cant zoom in and see the relation (site)
    - labels should activate inputs
  + Audio
    - audio should be accompanied with visual actions
  + [Managing focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management)
    - focus: the control on the screen that receives input from the keyboard and clipboard when you paste/type
      + determines where keyboard events go
      + not all elements are focusble by default, and will not be included in the tab order
  + Managing shortcuts:
    - implement the following:
      + some environemnts enforce all keyboard commands to also use command (e.g. on mac)
      + tab order: move through focusable (i.e. interactive elements, e.g. input, select, button) and not content elements (e.g. div )
        - elements are inserted into the tab order based on their position in the DOM
        - using css tabIndex to control the tab order
          + try to always use the natural tab order
        - an exception to adding tab order to non-interactive elements is when you're managing focus:
          1. reloading parts of a page without a full page refresh, and need to indicate to user what has changed
          2. in page navigation,  e.g. through #anchor links and need to inform user
      1. tab: move forward
      2. shift tab: move backward
      3. arrow keys: move within a component
      4. spacebar: select/deselect
    - skip links: allows keyboard users to skip to main content
      + `<a href='#your-main-content-id' class='skip-link'> skip to main content </a>`
        - this element should be position off screen when not focused (e.g. left: -40px;), and positioned on screen (E.g. top left corner) when focused
      + your main content should have a parent elementwith the corrosponding id
        - make sure to add tabindex='-1'
      + http://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/
    - roving focus: perfect for radio buttons, so that keyboarding through items in the radio will loop through from beginning to end
      + set the currently checked item to tabindex=0, and all other buttons inthe group to tabindex='-1' via an event listener
    - manage offscreen / hidden content that receives focus but does not appear on screen
      + you can log window.activeElement to get the exact element that is currently focused
      + check the chrome dev tools accessibilty audit chrome plugins
      + best practices:
        1. set visibility: hidden, display: none for offscreen/hidden items so they cannot receive focus, then do the opposite when they are to be visible/on screen
    - manage keyboard/modal traps
      - when you click into a (e.g a select element) in a modal, you may be unable to tab out of it, as the tab shortcut is trying to finish your autocomplete info
      - or when you are on a modal, and the modal is open but the user tabs out of the modal and returns to the main page but the modal is still open so the page looks disabled
        + keep track of the element that had focus before the modal was opened
        + trap the focus inside the modal until closes
          - this is done by listening for tab & shit.tab events and programmatically calling focus() to elements you allow
        + return focus to the previous element
  + Touch points:
    1. DOM order
    2. Managing focus
    3. Managing navigation via tabindex
    4. Keyboard shortcuts
    5. Semantics
    6. Labeling inputs
    7. Headings in sections
    8. Landmarks (html structural elements)
    9. Links
    10. ARIA roles and design patterns
      - https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions
      - https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/
      - https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/
    11. Ensuring only appropriate sections of a document are exposed to assistive technologies, or hidden from non-assistive technologies
      - http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/
    12. ensuring LIVE regions (i.e. updates) are communicated to users
    13. managing the styles and using aria-attributes instead of classes
    14. ensuring you have a responsive design for multiple devices
    15. breakdown existing acciessibility issues based on:
      1. is this a critical piece of the app functinoality?
      2. how frequently is this piece of UI/UX used?
      3. do we need to fix this?
    16. all of the above should ensure the ACCESSIBILITY TREE is as it should be
### Accessbility Semantics
#### Assistive technologies
  - assistive technologies: umbrella term that helps users complete some task
    +  browser zoom, braile display, voice control, screen readers, etc
#### Programmatically Expressed Semantics
  -  Semantics: the elements, and its attributes, is used in a way facitilitates its meanings programmaticaly to describe its functionality
    + for all user interface components:
      - the name and role can be programmatically determined
      - states, properties, and values can be programmatically set
    + screen readers convert a visual page into auditory sounds that users can enter information into
  - Attributes:
    + Role: what type of element it is
      - e.g. 'Edit Text'
    + Name (i.e. label text or text alternative): if it has one
      - Text Alternatives: for elements that do not have labels, e.g. images, buttons, etc.
        + the text associated with these (e.g. in the alt= or as a text node) because its name/label
        + imagine all your images are broken, and think of what you would need in the alt= to understand what the image should be
    + Value: if it has one
    + State: if it has any
  - The Accessibility tree: screen readers take the DOM and strip away its visible elements, to create an accessibility tree based on the programmatic semantics of the html elements
    + its all based on role, name, value, and state
  - Navigating Content: links, form controls, headings, and landmarks
    + Link Text: should be descriptive, not just 'click here', but the text should tell you exactly where it go
      - all links should have an href
      - the href= should never be href=#
      - anchors with child images: the image must have an alt text
    + Landmarks: describe areas of a page, versus a single element
      - main: only one per page
      - header: page banner or grouping element for introductory content for a section
      - footer: a page footer or grouping element for a section of a page
      - nav: a section of a page that links to other pages, or parts within a page
      - article: self contained sections of content, e.g. blog entry, forum posts, etc.
        + will the ocntent make sense in a another context?
      - section: generic section of a document or application
        + should contain a heading
      - aside: tangentialy related to the content around it
    + Headings: are the best thing to implement for screen readers
      - HEading order: follows the DOM Order and not the visual order of the page
        + get dom order of headings:
          ```
            for (var i = 0, headings = $$('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6');
                 i < headings.length; i++) {
               console.log(headings[i].textContent.trim() + " " +  
                           headings[i].tagName,
                           headings[i]);
            }
          ```
        + you can include headings off screen to help with screen readers, but do not go overboard
          - i.e. headings absolutely positioned off screen
#### Semantics ARIA
 + ARIA is used to express semantics that native html elements cannot express on its own
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/
  - modifies how elements are translated into the accessibility tree via custom attributes
    + great when you need to use a div (instead of a checkbox) but still need that div to show up as a checkbox to assistive technologies
  - ARIAs only purpose is to modify the accessibility tree, it does not:
    + modify element appearance
    + modify element behavior
    + add focusability
    + add keyboard handling
      - all of the above must be handled by javascript ;)
  - ARIA breakdown:
    + role: the semantic meaning of the element
      - includes superclass, subclass, and related concepts (roles) that have similar, but not identical semantics
    + inherited states/properties: attributes that can be used with the given role, some are requied, others are optional
    + Name from: where the name (label) will be retrieved from, e.g.
      - the text content
      - or the html author
    + important attributes:
      - name:
        - aria-label: screen reader only name
        - aria-labelledby=id: specify another element that provides the name for this element
        - aria-describedby=id: additional text describing this element is provided by some other element
      - ARIA landmark roles: banner, navigation, main, complementary, search, dialog, contentinfo
      - relationships:
        + aria-owns="id1 id2 id3 idX" specify this element owns the other element(S), and should be listed as the parent of them all in the accessibility tree
          + this modifies the hierarchy of the accessibility tree
        + aria-activedescendant='idX': when the parent has focus, this element should actually be the one given focus
          - this way the parent can keep actual focus and receive keyboard events, while the idX is updated to the element that should be visually given focus
        + aria-describedby: extra explanatary text that a user may need
        + aria-posinset: 1-based position in set, e.g. x out of y. used with aria-setsize
        + aria-setsize: relationship between sibling elements in a set, used with aria-posinset
          -  perfect for lazy loading, to specify the total number of items in a set, even when some of the items have not been loaded yet
        + aria-hidden: hide elements from assistive technologies
        + aria-live=off|polite|assertive: specify that updates should be communicated to users as soon as it hits the DOM
          - e.g. status updates
          - polite: alert when no other alerts are happening
          - assertive: interrupt and alert immediately
          - aria-live region should be in the initial page load
          - set it on the parent most element
          - related attributes:
            + aria-atomic: whether the entire region should be communicated to the user
            + aria-relevant=additions|removals|text|all: what should be communicated to the user
      - states
        + aria-pressed: indicated if the state of this button/interactive element is pressed|clicked
        + aria-hidden: element is hidden
        + aria-expanded: element is open


### Accessibility Styles
  + importing styles:
    - style via aria attributes with attribute selectors: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors
  + Focus
    - Styles: :focus, :hover, :before,
    - properties: outline, box-shadow
      radio:focus::before { some styles }
  + Design
    - always use <meta name=viewport
    - always use responsive grid
  + Fonts:
    - use relative units as much as possible (e.g. em, rem)
  + Touches:
    - at least 48dp minimum touch size per touch target (average size of a finger)
    - at least 32dp minimum margin around touch targets (so you dont accidently touch another thing)
  + color and contrast:
    - contrast ratio: body text and images have a high contrast with background color
      + http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
    - dont convey info with color and contrast alone, always provide additional help text

## TRICKS
  - check if someVar is an Array (or anything, e.g. Number, or Object)
      `if(someVar && Array === todoItems.constructor)``
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor

  - convert function arguments to array
    ```
      function () {
          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments
            var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
      }
    ```
## Forms:
  - best practices
    1. should have progress meter
    2. should be quick to finish
    3. validation messages should be clear and located next to their errors
    4. inputs should have placeholders
    5. inputs should autocomplete based on users known data
	- links
    - [creating amazing forms](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/input/?hl=en)
    - [Location Example](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/geolocation/trip_meter/)

### Form Examples
  - label with datalist
    ```

## TERMINOLOGY
  - web sockets: a persistent connection to a server
  - sourcemaps: tell the browser to convert line and column offsets 'for' exceptions thrown in the bundle file back into the offsets and filenames of the original sources.
  - transpilation: ES6 > Babel > ES5

# promises and asynchronous code
  - aynchronous: statements occur in multiple timelines, in an unknown order irregardless of how they are defined in code
      e.g. network requests, events, threads, timeouts, etc.
  - synchronous: statements happen in order as defined, in a single timeline
  - callbacks: pass one function (cb) to another function, and the cb is invoked when certain conditions are met
    + problems:
      1. how do you handle errors ? do all type of errors get handled the same way ?
      2. Pyramid of doom / callback hell:
## Promises:
  - try catch wrapper around code that will finish at an unpredictable time
  - Promise States
    1. fulfilled (resolved): action related to the promise has succeeded
    2. rejected (failure): action related to the promise has failed
    3. pending: not yet fulfilled / rejected
    4. settled: promise has either fulfilled / rejected.
      - a promise can only be settled once, whereas events can fire multiple times
      - promises are potentially blocking since they are created and settled on the main thread
  - Promise stages:
    1. wrapping: (value promise creation)
      + create a promise that wrapps an async action
    2. thening (value -> action):
      + any object that returns a .then is thenable
      + any thenable can become part of a chain of thens/asynchronous work
    3. catching (value -> recovery):
      + javascript calls the NEXT CATCH in the chain when an error occurs or a promise is rejected
      ```
        all of the below are the
        .catch(....)
        .then(undefined, rejectFunc)
        .then(resolve, rejectFunc)
      ```
    4. chaining (value -> promise):
  - Promise Methods
    1. Promise.Resolve(): create a promise without calling new
      ```
        var blah = Promise.Resolve();
        blah.then(...);
      ```
    2. Promise.Reject(): see Promise.Resolve();
    3. Promise.all([pro1, pro2,...]): takes an array of promises and returns an array of values in the same order as the original promises
        ```
          Promise.all([...])
            .then(...)
        ```
        - fails fast: will reject as soon as the first promise rejects, without waiting for the remaining promises to settle
### Promise Examples
#### Promise constructor:
  ```
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (true) resolve(value);
      else reject();
      // do some other stuff
      // even if resolve is called first, finish all code inside of this block
    }).then((value) => { //then is passed whatever was passed to resolve()
      //success
    }).catch(rejectFunction) // handles both reject and javascript errors
    .then(someNamedFucntion) // passed a name function that accepts the argument
    .catch(...) // thens and catches *can* come right after each other
    .then(....)
    .then(undefined, rejectFunc) // this is long form of .catch(...)
    .then(resolve, reject) // combine both .then and .catch in one go
  ```
#### Promise Chaining
  **Series: multiple promises run sequentially**
  ```
    var sequence = Promise.resolve(); // create a promise without the new keyword, can also use Promise.reject()
    blah.forEach(function(url) {
      sequence = sequence.then(...); //each request is added to the previous request and executed in sequence
    })
  ```
  **Parallel: multiple promises run concurrently**
  ```
    var sequence = Promise.resolve(); // create a promise without the new keyword, can also use Promise.reject()
    blah.forEach(function(url) {
      sequence.then(...); //each request is fired independently and in parallel
    })
  ```

# WINDOW

## [window.fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API):
  - simplified XMLhttpRequest
### Fetch examples
  - fetch with a request object
  `fetch(requestObject).then(...)`

  - Simple response handling
  ```
    fetch('https://davidwalsh.name/some/url')
      .then(function(response) {

      }).catch(function(err) {
      	// Error :(
      });
  ```

  - url (required), options (optional)
  ```
    fetch('https://davidwalsh.name/some/url', {
    	method: 'get'
    }).then(function(response) {

    }).catch(function(err) {
    	// Error :(
    });
  ```

  - Chaining for more "advanced" handling
  ```
    fetch('https://davidwalsh.name/some/url')
    .then(function(response) {
    	return //...
    }).then(function(returnedValue) {
    	// ...
    }).catch(function(err) {
    	// Error :(
    });
  ```

  - The fetch signature, however, acts like Request so you could also do:
  ```
    fetch('https://davidwalsh.name/users.json', {
    	method: 'POST',
    	mode: 'cors',
    	redirect: 'follow',
    	headers: new Headers({
    		'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
    	})
    }).then(function() { /* handle response */ });
  ```

## [window.Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
  - A Request instance represents the request piece of a fetch call.
    + important properties
        1. method - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD
        2. url - URL of the request
        3. headers - associated Headers object
        4. referrer - referrer of the request
        5. mode - cors, no-cors, same-origin
        6. credentials - should cookies go with the request? omit, same-origin
        7. redirect - follow, error, manual
        8. integrity - subresource integrity value
        9. cache - cache mode (default, reload, no-cache)
### Request examples
  **sample request and fetch**
    ```
      var request = new Request('https://davidwalsh.name/users.json', {
        method: 'POST',
        mode: 'cors',
        redirect: 'follow',
        headers: new Headers({
          'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
        })
      });
      // Now use it!
      fetch(request).then(function() { /* handle response */ });
    ```

## [window.Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response):
  - properties
    1. type - basic, cors
    2. url
    3. useFinalURL - Boolean for if url is the final URL
    4. status - status code (ex: 200, 404, etc.)
    5. ok - Boolean for successful response (status in the range 200-299)
    6. statusText - status code (ex: OK)
    7. headers - Headers object associated with the response.
  - methods
    1. clone() - Creates a clone of a Response object. VERY USFUL! as you can only read a response body once, so clone it to read it multipel tiems (e.g. to send to multiple places)
    2. error() - Returns a new Response object associated with a network error.
    3. redirect() - Creates a new response with a different URL.
    4. arrayBuffer() - Returns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer.
    5. blob() - Returns a promise that resolves with a Blob.
    6. formData() - Returns a promise that resolves with a FormData object.
    7. json() - Returns a promise that resolves with a JSON object.
    8. text() - Returns a promise that resolves with a USVString (text).
### response examples
  - json example
    ```
      fetch('https://davidwalsh.name/demo/arsenal.json').then(function(response) {
      	// Convert to JSON
      	return response.json();
      }).then(function(j) {
      	// Yay, `j` is a JSON object
      	console.log(j);
      });
    ```

## [window.Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)
  - Allows you to perform various actions on HTTP request and response headers. These actions include retrieving, setting, adding to, and removing.
### headers examples
  - Create an empty Headers instance
    ```
      var headers = new Headers();
      // Add a few headers
      headers.append('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
      headers.append('X-My-Custom-Header', 'CustomValue');
      // Check, get, and set header values
      headers.has('Content-Type'); // true
      headers.get('Content-Type'); // "text/plain"
      headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      // Delete a header
      headers.delete('X-My-Custom-Header');
      // Add initial values
      var headers = new Headers({
        'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
        'X-My-Custom-Header': 'CustomValue'
      });
    ```

## [window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage)
  - localStorage is the same as sessionStorage with the same same-origin rules applied but it is persistent.
### localStorage examples
  ```
    localStorage.setItem('thisVar','toThisString')
    localStorage.getItem('thisVar')
    localStorage.removeItem('thisVar')
    localStorage.clear();
  ```

## [window.indexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
  - IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high performance searches of this data.
  - background:
    - positives:
      + every major browser supports indexeddb
    - negatives:
      + is async but predates promsies, so its eventbased system is horrid.
        1. use [IndexedDB Promised library instead](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb)
  - location: resources > indexedDB

  - structure:
    + db: can be multiple per website
      + object store: each db can have multiple object stores (i.e. tables) to store data
          - object stores can only be created via the upgrade funcion when creating the DB
            - you have to bump up the version to modify the object store (e.g. add object stores / create indexes)
            - upgrade version only gets called with the upgradeDb() function
        - values: any data type, each item can have a primary key/one of its values can be set as the primary key
        - transactions: (i.e. CRUD), all CRUD operations must be part of a transaction
          1. if a transaction fails for a series of steps/actions, none of the steps/actions are applied and the whole transaction is reverted
          2. create a transaction object > use it to return an objectStore > operate CRUD on object store
        - indexes: you can create multiple indexes per object store, which orders (i.e. sorts) the values by a specific property making it faster to look up

  - API
    - indexedDb: found on window object
      1. .deleteDatabase('dbName')
    - IDBObjectStore: interface for an object store
      - methods: add, clear, delete, get, getAll, getAllKeys, etc.
      - properties: indexNames, keyPath, name, transaction, autoIncrement
### [idb promised](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb)
  - idb: IndexedDB Promised; a library built to convert IndexedDB to promises
  - background: whenever IndexeDB would return a request, IDB returns a promise
#### idb promised examples
  - open DB: always use in switch statement
    ```
      const someDb = idb.open('someDbName',3, (upgradeDb){
        switch(upgradeDb.oldVersion) {
          case 0:
            // original create db
            someTable = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('someName1');
            // all db 0 version logic here
          case 1:
            //add new object store with key id
            someOtherTable = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('someName2', { keyPath: 'id' })
            // all db version 2 logic here
          case 2:
            //modify someTable and add new index
            var someTable = upgradeDb.transaction.objectStore('someName1');
          someTable.createIndex('animal', 'favriteAnimal'); // index name = animal, sorts on key favoriteAnimal
        }
      })
    ```
  - create db and create record
    ```
      const dbName = idb.open('newDbName', 1, (upgradeDb) => {
        const keyValStore = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('keyval');
        keyValStore.put('value', 'keyName') // create record
        // create objectStore and define index
        upgradeDb.createObjectStore('people', { keyPath: 'name' });
      })
    ```
  - read from db
    ```
      dbName.then((db) => {
        const transaction = db.transaction('keyval');
        const keyValStore = transaction.objectStore('keyval');
        return keyValStore.get('keyName'); // returns promise
      }).then((value) => {
        console.log('the value from transaction is', value);
      })
    ```
  - read and write to db
    ```
      dbName.then((db) => {
        const transaction = db.transaction('keyval', 'readwrite');
        const keyValStore = transaction.objectStore('keyval');
        keyValStore.put('value', 'keyName');
        return transaction.complete; // returns promise
      }).then(() => {
        console.log('transaction completed successfully if promise resolves');
      })
    ```
  - get all records
    ```
      dbName.then(function(db) {
        var tx = db.transaction('people');
        var peopleStore = tx.objectStore('people');
        return peopleStore.getAll(); // all objects in store

        //or get all people by idnex
        var ageIndex = peopleStore.index('age');
        return ageIndex.getAll(); // all objects in store

      }).then(function(people) {
        console.log('people', people)
      })
    ```
  - get records one at a time
    ```
      dbName.then(function(db) {
        var tx = db.transaction('people');
        var peopleStore = tx.objectStore('people');
        var ageIndex = peopleStore.index('age');
        return ageIndex.openCursor();

        //loop through records backwords
        store.index('indexName')
          .openCursor(null, 'prev')
          .then(function(cursor){...})

      }).then(function(cursor) {
        if (!cursor)  return;
        // skip first two items
        return cursor.advance(2);
      }).then(function logPerson(cursor){
        if (!cursor) return;
        console.log('cursored at', cursor.value.keyName);
        // cursor.update(newValue)
        // cursor.delete()
        return cursor.continue().then(logPerson); // recursively call logPerson
      }).then(function() {
        console.log('done cursoring');
      })
    ```

## [window.document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document)
### document important properties
  - readyState: has 3 States (values); everytime readState changes, a ready state change event fires
    1. loading: document still loading
    2. interactive: document has loaded and has been parsed, but sub resources (images, css, frames, etc) hasnt loaded
      + loaded === dom.contentLoaded event
      useful for running code after all of the initial DOM content has been loaded
    3. complete: everything has loaded
### document examples
  - implement jQuery on .ready() handler:
    ```
      function ready() {
        // Credit to Jake Archibald
        // https://github.com/jakearchibald/svgomg/blob/master/src/js/page/utils.js#L7
        return new Promise(function(resolve) {
          function checkState() {
            if (document.readyState !== 'loading') {
              resolve();
            }
          }
          document.addEventListener('readystatechange', checkState);
          checkState();
        });
      };
      ready().then(run your other code);
    ```

## window.navigator
  - The Navigator interface represents the state and the identity of the user agent. It allows scripts to query it and to register themselves to carry on some activities.

### [window.navigator.serviceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
  - service worker: javascript file that sits between you and network requests, listens for and reacts to arbitrary events
    + each page the service worker controls, it hijacks all events and allows you to operate on them.
    + are limited to HTTPS, since intercepting network requests can be super dangerous in the wrong hands
  - service worker hijaking workflow:
    1. client loads
    2. service workers interact with caches
    3. service workers interact with http caches
    4. service workers interact with network/internet
  - network flow: browser requests > service worker > http cache > internet
  - gotchas
    - browsers only update service workers on page reload, or if there is a change to the SW (e.g. change cache name)
      + the new SW will have its only install event so you can use this time to get an updated cache
  - use cases:
    1. adding offline support
    2. control the cache
    3. sending push notifications
      + You could send push notifications from the browser to your users about new posts, even if the client has closed your page, since service workers are in constant communication with your server in background.
    4. doing background sync with service workers
    5. Capability reporting
    6. Client-side Load Balancer
    7. Differential update of text files
    8. Support a previous unsupported image format in your browser!
    9. Save forms information even if theres no internet at the moment: Your application could have a huge form to send information for and, in case the user lost connection, the information could be saved in a Service Worker, even when the user is offline, and be sent to your server when the connection is back.
    10. Faster page loads: You could cache scripts, images, stylesheets, static pages, etc on a Service Worker on a first page-load and run a faster page loading on subsequent requests. The approach is almost the same if you relate it with browser caching but differs with when talking about requests: browser caching requests are always made and stops only if you already have the information needed and with Service Workers caching, no requests are made to the server.
    11. for some changes (e.g. minor, or security fixes) you may want to force changes to users
  - LIFE CYCLE:
    1. install:
      - the browser wont let the SW take control of pages until the install phase is completed
      - opportunity to get everything you need from the network/internet, and cache them
    2. waiting:
    3. activate: when the SW is ready to start working on pages.
    4. redundant:
  - process:
    1. service workers are instantiated via javascript in the window, and can only take control of pages that are LOADED after they are instantiated.
      - page 1 loads > instantiates sw registration file > makes requests (none are intercepted)
      - user refreshes (causes new load) > sw still in browser > requests are intercepted
    2. service worker intercepts all requests and triggers a 'fetch' event for each
    3. instantiating a new SW can only occur if all pages controlled by the current SW are gone. this ensures only one version of your site exists at any given time
      - the new SW is in 'waiting' mode until the current SW is gone
      - only occurs if the page closes, or the user navigates to a page not controlled by the current SW
    4. users are notified that a new SW is ready by changing the browser hamburger button in the top right (at least on chrome)
      - when the browser refetches a service worker, it goes through the browser cache for all requests
      - it is good to set your SW CACHE TIME TO ZERO!!!! this way they are updated as soon as possible
        -updates to will bypass the browser cache if the SW it has is > than the cache time
  - DEV TOOLS:
    1. click the down arrow next to 'top' and select your SW file
    2. now you can interact with your SW
      self.registration

    3. you can debug SW same as anything else:
      sources > click SW file > set breakpoints, etc.
    4. click the application/resources tab and select the SW option
  - Basic steps:
    + registration
      1. in a script on the page, register a service worker
      2. the service worker is registered on an origin, and controls a subset of paths (or root, for all paths)
        navigator.serviceWorker.register....
    + do stuff!
      1. intercept network requests/events and do something with them (e.g. store the response in cache)
        self.addEventListener....
          caches.open...
      2. events: install, fetch,
          event.someMethod()
      3. caches.open(...)
          cache.someMethod()
  - methods
    + postMessaage(): send messages to/from SW
    + skipWaiting()
      - forces the waiting service worker to become the active service worker.
      - call this when a user hits the refresh button
  - events
    + INSTALL: when a browser sets up a SW for the first time, the install event is fired.
    + ACTIVATE: when a new SW is finished installing and ready to control pages, use this event to delete old caches
    + FETCH: every browser request triggers a fetch, useful for hijacking/intercepting
    + MESSAGE: receive/post messages from/to the client (i.e. a page/document)
#### window.navigator.serviceWorker by MDN tutorial
 + [url is here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers)
 - step 1 is to register your someWorker.js file
  1. in your html file, include a registration.js file that registers specific service workers against an origin and path
    ```
      if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw-test/sw.js', {scope: '/sw-test/'})
        .then(function(reg) {
          // registration worked
          console.log('Registration succeeded. Scope is ' + reg.scope);
        }).catch(function(error) {
          // registration failed
          console.log('Registration failed with ' + error);
        });
      }
    ```
#### window.navigator.serviceWorker examples
  - registering service workers, returns a registration object
    ```
      in home.html
      if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker.register('path/to/your/SW.js', {scope: 'some/path'})
          // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration
          // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register
          .then(function(reg) {
            // an update or initial install is in progress
            if(reg.installing) {
              // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker
              let sw = reg.installing
                // grab this sw from the reg object
              // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Client/postMessage
              sw.postMessage({...}); // send data back to service worker script
              console.log(sw.state);
                // returns installing, installed, activating, activated, redundant (thrown away)
              sw.addEventListener('statechange', function(){
                // whenever sw.state changes
                if (this.state === 'installed') //tell user to refresh browser!
              })
            } else if(reg.waiting) {
              // an update is in the pipeline and ready to be activated
              // tell the user to refresh their content! e.g. by a web socket

## [window.Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)
  + Web worker: runs separately from the page, isnt visible to the user, cant access the DOM,
        .it intercepts and controls requests made by the browser

## [window.caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/cache)
  - updating static cache:
    1. create new SW
    2. remove old SW
    3. when #1 is actived, deleted old cache
    4. create new cache
  - see cache: dev tools > resources/application > cache storage
  - cache names in prod should be auto generated and cache times set to a year a more, when the file changes, you can just upload the new file (with a different name) and that will force an update since the url to the file changes
    + be sure the cache names are versioned or auto-generated, e.g. somecache-v1 | somecache-!@#s
  - opening a cache returns a response objects
    +  a response object can only be used once, you will need to call response.clone() to use it more than once
  - methods
    1. caches.open('createOrOpenACache').then(function(cache){...})
      + create or open a cache-box by name
      + returns a promise of request and response pairs from any secure origin
      + can store fonts, scripts, images, etc. from your origin, and any origin on the web
    2. cache.put(request, response);
      + store a request response in
    3. cache.addAll([request1, request2, 'url3', 'url4'])
      + accepts request objects / urls, makes the requests, and stores the results
      + are atomic requests, if any fail, none are added
    4. cache.match(requestObjectOrUrlString)
      + retrieve something from the cache
      + returns matching response or null
    5. caches.match(requestObjectOrUrlString)
      + same as cache.match, only searches ALL CACHES starting with the oldest first
      + retrieve response from cache for all matching requests
    6. caches.delete('cacheName|cacheObject') //always clean your cache
    7. caches.keys() //get names of all your caches
### cache examples
  - check if request is in cache
    ```
      self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
        event.respondWith(
          caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
            console.log('res', response);
            if (response) return response;
            return fetch(event.request);
          }).catch(function(error) {
            console.log('err', error);
            return fetch(event.request);
          })
        );
      });
    ```

# ES5:
  prototypical inheritance:

# [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)

## Strings
  ```
    "abcde".includes("cd") // true
    "abc".repeat(3) // "abcabcabc"
    `${some var or function call} some string`
  ```
## numbers
  ```
    Number.EPSILON
    Number.isInteger(Infinity) // false
    Number.isNaN("NaN") // false
  ```
## Math
  ```
    Math.acosh(3) // 1.762747174039086
    Math.hypot(3, 4) // 5
    Math.imul(Math.pow(2, 32) - 1, Math.pow(2, 32) - 2) // 2
  ```
## Arrays:
  ```
    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*')) // Returns a real Array
    Array.of(1, 2, 3) // Similar to new Array(...), but without special one-arg behavior
    [0, 0, 0].fill(7, 1) // [0,7,7]
    [1, 2, 3].find(x => x == 3) // 3
    [1, 2, 3].findIndex(x => x == 2) // 1
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].copyWithin(3, 0) // [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
    ["a", "b", "c"].entries() // iterator [0, "a"], [1,"b"], [2,"c"]
    ["a", "b", "c"].keys() // iterator 0, 1, 2
    ["a", "b", "c"].values() // iterator "a", "b", "c"
  ```
## Objects
    Object Literals:
      {
        // __proto__
        __proto__: theProtoObj,
        blah,
        function() {...},
        ['one' + id]: 'computed property'
      }
## Operators
  - Spread Operator: expands an array/object into elements, i.e. flatten arrays and objects in function calls, array literals, destructuring assignment
    `myFunction(...iterableObj);`
    `[...iterableObj, 4, 5, 6]`
  - Destructuring: pull values out of arrays/objects and assign them to variables
    + arrays
      ```
        [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        console.log(a); // 1
        console.log(b); // 2
        console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5]
      ```
    + objects
      ```
        ({a, b} = {a:1, b:2});
        console.log(a); // 1
        console.log(b); // 2
      ```
    + assign new var names:
      ```
        var o = {p: 42, q: true};
        var {p: foo, q: bar} = o;
        console.log(foo); // 42
        console.log(bar); // true
      ```
    + Fail-soft destructuring
      ```
        var [a] = [];
        a === undefined;
      ```
## Functions:
  - Default Arguments
    `function drawES6Chart({size = 'big', cords = { x: 0, y: 0 }, radius = 25} = {}) {..}`
  - Rest Parameters/: used in function arguments to capture a list of variables from arrays
    ```
      function(a, b, ...theArgs) {
        // ...
      }
    ```
### Arrow functions:
## Classes:
    - function declarations are hoisted, classes are not
    - creating
      ```
        class Polygon {
          constructor({...options}) {
            this.height = height;
            this.width = width;
          }
          get area() {
            return this.calcArea();
          }
          set matrixType(matrixType) {
            this.idMatrix = matrixType;
          }
          static distance(a, b) {
            //not callable from instances
            const dx = a.x - b.x;
            const dy = a.y - b.y;

            return Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
          }
        }
      ```
    - extending
      ```
        class OtherShape extends Polygon {
          constructor({...options}) {
            super(options); //parent.constructor()
            this.blah = blah;
          }
          area2() {
            // call parent method
            super.area();
          }
        }
      ```
## Generators: a function that can be exited, and entered multiple times
  - yield: exit the function and send a value to the caller, and optionally receive a value back
  - function.next(): retrieve and send data, executes up to and including the next yield statement
    + for each yield statement you need to call blah.next()
    + returns ``{value: 'dataInAndOut', done: true|false}``
      1. value: data sent out from yield, or data sent in through next(someData);
      2. done:
        - false if function is not done, and can be entered again
        - true: if function is done, and should not be re-entered
    + you can access the value directly: `bloop.next().value;``
  - use cases
    + asynchornous events
    + timers (e.g. setInterval)
### Generators examples
  - send and receive data
    ```
      function* someName() {
        yield 'someValue'; //send data without accepting a return value
        const getIt = yield; //receive data without sending a value
        const getIt = yield 'someOtherValue'; // send and receive data

        return 'someFinalValue'; // exit permanently
      }
      const blah = someName(); // always call the function immediately to get everything up to the first yield
      blah.next(optionalParam) // enter and continue the function
    ```

  - use with 'for' of loops
    ```
      function* colors() {
        yield 'red'; yield 'blue';
      }
      for (let color of colors()) {
        console.log(color)
      }
    ```
## Iterators:
### Iterators examples
  - create fibonacci sequence
    ```
      let fibonacci = {
        [Symbol.iterator]() {
          let pre = 0, cur = 1;
          return {
            next() {
              [pre, cur] = [cur, pre + cur];
              return { done: false, value: cur }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      for (var n of fibonacci) {
        if (n > 1000) break;
        console.log(n);
      }
    ```
  - combine generators with iterators:
    ```
      var fibonacci = {
        [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {
          var pre = 0, cur = 1;
          for (;;) {
            var temp = pre;
            pre = cur;
            cur += temp;
            yield cur;
          }
        }
      }

      for (var n of fibonacci) {
        // truncate the sequence at 1000
        if (n > 1000)
          break;
        console.log(n);
      }
    ```
## Loops:
  ```
    'for..of': iterating arrays
      for (let color of colors) {
        // color = each item in the array
      }
  ```
## Map, weakmap
### Maps
    var m = new Map();
    m.set("hello", 42);
    m.set(s, 34);
    m.get(s) == 34;
    // Weak Maps
    //  WeakMaps provides leak-free object-key’d side tables.
    var wm = new WeakMap();
    wm.set(s, { extra: 42 });
    wm.size === undefined
## Set, weakset
    // Sets
    var s = new Set();
    s.add("hello").add("goodbye").add("hello");
    s.size === 2;
    s.has("hello") === true;
    // Weak Sets
    var ws = new WeakSet();
    ws.add({ data: 42 });
      // Because the added object has no other references, it will not be held in the set
  proxies: Proxies enable creation of objects with the full range of behaviors available to host objects. Can be used 'for' interception, object virtualization, logging/profiling, etc.

  reflect
  tail
  module loaders:
    // Dynamic loading – ‘System’ is default loader
    System.import('lib/math').then(function(m) {
      alert("2π = " + m.sum(m.pi, m.pi));
    });
    // Create execution sandboxes – new Loaders
    var loader = new Loader({
      global: fixup(window) // replace ‘console.log’
    });
    loader.eval("console.log('hello world!');");
    // Directly manipulate module cache
    System.get('jquery');
    System.set('jquery', Module({$: $})); // WARNING: not yet finalized
## keywords
### let: defines block scoped variables
  ```
    var x = 10 (global)
    if (x){
      var x = 5 //overrides the global x, and sets it to 5
          //this is because the if block does not define a new scope
    }
    if (x){
      let x = 2 //this x is only available within this if statement
    }
  ```
  - where to use
    ```
      for (let i = 0; i<blah;i++){
        i is no longer overridden on each loop
      }
    ```
### const: set constant vars that should not be reasigned
  - example: `const name = "noah";`
## async await
  - Note that await may only be used in functions marked with the async keyword
  - suspends execution in your context until the promise settles
  - an Async Function always returns a Promise
    ```
      async ()=> {
        var data = await makeCall();
      }
    ```
  - A function with multiple await expressions will run each in serial.
    ```
      async ()=> {
        var data = await makeCall();
        var data2 = await makeCall2();
        var data3 = awat makeCall3();
      }
    ```

  - to run a bunch of calls at the same time
    ```
      async function concurrent () {
        var [r1, r2, r3] = await Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]);
      }
    ```
  - another version of the above
    ```
      const all = Promise.all.bind(Promise);
      async function concurrent () {
        var [r1, r2, r3] = await all([p1, p2, p3]);
      }
    ```
# ES7: (ES2016)
## destructuring:
  `({a, b, ...rest} = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4});`

# EVENTS
	event.preventDefault(): stops the browser from continuiing to process the event, it does not stop propagation
	event.stopPropoagation(): prevents further propagation of the event in the capturing and bubbling phases
## ADD EVENT LISTENERS
	  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
		API
		  target.addEventListener(type, listener[, options]);
		  target.addEventListener(type, listener[, useCapture]);
		  target.addEventListener(type, listener[, useCapture, wantsUntrusted  ]); // Gecko/Mozilla only
		    target = domnode|document|window
		    type = event
		    listerner = js function|callback, gets passed the event object as its only argument
				-type: string; event type
					event types: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
				-listener: an object that receives a notition that implements the event interface or is some other capable javascript function
					-events: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
					-event listener: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener
				-options: object that specifies characteristis about the event listener containing properties capture, once, passive, and mozSystemGroup
		example 1:
		  // Check if pointer events are supported.
		  if (window.PointerEventSupport) {
			  // Add Pointer Event Listener
			  swipeFrontElement.addEventListener(pointerDownName, this.handleGestureStart, true);
		  } else {
			  // Add Touch Listener
			  swipeFrontElement.addEventListener('touchstart', this.handleGestureStart, true);
			  // Add Mouse Listener
			  swipeFrontElement.addEventListener('mousedown', this.handleGestureStart, true);
		  }

		example 2:
			<table id="outside">
				<tr><td id="t1">one</td></tr>
				<tr><td id="t2">two</td></tr>
			</table>

				// Function to change the content of t2
			function modifyText() {
			  var t2 = document.getElementById("t2");
			  if (t2.firstChild.nodeValue == "three") {

			    t2.firstChild.nodeValue = "three";
			  }
			}

			// add event listener to table
			var el = document.getElementById("outside");
			el.addEventListener("click", modifyText, false);
## REMOVE EVENT LISTENERS
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener
## TOUCH EVENTS
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events
		-background
			.low level APIs to support application specific touch interactions like two finger gestures
			.are similar to mouse events except they support simultaneous touches and at different locations on the touch surface
			.the TouchEvent interface encapsulates all of the touch points that are currently active
		-events:
			.touchstart: indicates  a new touch on the surface has occurred
				.there are various properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchstart
			.touchmove: indicates a touch point is moved along the touch surface
				.has various properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchmove
			.touchend: when a touch point is removed from the touch surface
				.properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchend
			.touchcancel: fired when a touch point has been disrupted
				.properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchcancel
			.touchmove: fired when a touch point is moved along the touch surface

		-tips
			.setup event handlers on the body.onload attribute and attach event handlers to all elements that require it
			.calling evt.preventDefault() on touchstart / first touchmove will cancel mouse events
				-instead only call preventDefault() on touchmove, or fire touch events as mouse events

	  Use the event object to tailor actions to events.
	    Each touch event includes three lists of touches.
	      touches: a list of all fingers currently on the screen.
	      targetTouches: a list of fingers on the current DOM element.
	      changedTouches: a list of fingers involved in the current event. For example, in a touchend event, this will be the finger that was removed.
	    These lists consist of objects that contain touch information:
	      identifier: a number that uniquely identifies the current finger in the touch session.
	      target: the DOM element that was the target of the action.
	      client/page/screen coordinates: where on the screen the action happened.
	      radius coordinates and rotationAngle: describe the ellipse that approximates finger shape.

	  -some mobile browsers will select text if a user long touches on the screen, which can be super annoying, disable by:
	    -moz-user-select: none;
	    -webkit-user-select: none;
	    -ms-user-select: none;
	    user-select: none;

gotchas
	apparently toString || valueOf is called when you just take the object
		obj = {a:b} ; and then just type obj will return obj.toString() || obj.valueOf;
    html attribute data-BLAH
        if you have multipel elements with the same 'class' 'images';
        each with a data-BLAH='somethingElse';
        you can grab with jquery
            $(.images).click(function (e){
                $(this.data('blah'))
            })
	if you use: export default
	requires: import someFunction, {someOtherFunction} from 'someModule'
	if you dont use export default, but instead use export var blah, export var blah 2,
	requires: import * as moduleName from 'someModule'
	check if variable exists
		if(typeof(yourVar) !== 'undefined'){do stuff}


	object.create vs new
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4166616/understanding-the-difference-between-object-create-and-new-somefunction

			-set obj.__proto__ to Test.prototype
			-return obj; //So basically Object.create doesnt execute the constructor.

# patterns
## creation patterns
### factory pattern:
			-a function that creates other objects based on supplied arguments
			-e.g. document.createElement() creates html elements of the given type
			-you should always run validation on the arguments before creating the requested object

### singleton pattern:
			-a 'class'/object/module/etc that only has one instance with a global pont of access (so it can be accessed anywhere)
			-the singleton is not the class/object/module, but it is the logic that ensures there is only one instance of the class/object/etc
				-you either return the instance, or you create and then return the instance
					return instance || (instance = createInstance());

### constructor pattern
		object.create

## structural patterns

### callback pattern
			function randomCallBack(goodData, callback){
			  //both get called
			  callback(undefined, goodData); //no error, good data returned
			  callback('error message', undefined); //error, setting good data undefined
			}

			randomCallBack('something to send to callback', function(err,gooddata){
			  if (err) {
			    console.log(err);
			  }else {
			    console.log('good data');
			  }
			})

### promise pattern
			function randomPromise(otherdata){
			  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject){ //make sure to return THIS!
			    setTimeout(function(){
			      console.log('past resolve & reject function calls in here to fake delay');

			    }, 5000) //change the delay time
			    //if things go good, call resolve
			    return resolve('good data'); //make sure to return

			    //all things bad, call reject
			    return reject('error message here'); //make sure to return
			  });
			}

			randomPromise('ooh send this to promise')
		  .then( //only success or err is called
		    function(success){
		      console.log('promise success received: ' + success);
		    },
		    function(err){
		      console.log('promise error received: ' + err);
		    }
		  );

### facade pattern:
			any function that wraps other functions to make them easier to use
			-function A: has 10 methods related to calling, 20 methods relted to talking, and 2 methods related to
			-function B has three methods: call, talk, hangup, that  utilize  all of function A methods but only allows the user to use the three functions available.
				-this allows you to call talk and hangup, without having to know about the 1000 methods of function A.

### command pattern:
			-separate the responsibility of issueing commands from executing commands
			-objects are usually nouns (person, place, or thing) but are used as verbs (walk, run, talk)
			-object A = noun: has properties needed to take actions and methods to issue (request) actions, but does not execute any actions
			-object B = verb, has all of methods needed to execute commands that other objects issue (request)

				//create a calculator object (noun)
				function Calculator() {
					this._currentValue = 0;
					this.commands = []; //list of commands used, in order
				}

				Calculator.prototype = {
					//issue the command
					execute: function (command) {
						this._currentValue = command.execute(this._currentValue);
						this.commands.push(command); //add this command to our commands array
					}
					getCurrentValue: function() {
						return this._currentValue;
					}
					undo: function () {
						var cmd = this.commands.pop(); //get the last used command
						this._currentValue = cmd.undo(this._currentValue);
					}
					comm
				}

				//create a command object (verb) that executes commands
				function Command(fn, undo, value) {
					this.execute = fn; //execute this function, e.g. Add
					this.value = value; //keep track of value
					this.undo = undo; //keep track of the undo fn, e.g. Sub
				}

				//commands to execute
				function add(value) {
					return value + this.value;
				}
				function sub(value) {
					return value - this.value
				}
				function AddCommand(value) {
					Command.call(
						this, //this arg inside command
						add, //execute
						sub, //undo
						value //the value supplied by user
					)
				}
				function Subcommand(value) {
					Command.call(
						this, //this arg inside command
						sub, //execute
						add, //undo
						value //the value supplied by user
					)
				}

				var thisCalc = new Calculator();
				calc.execute(new AddCommand(5)); //adds 5 to 0 the initial number
				calc.execute(new AddCommand(5)); //adds 5 to 5
				calc.execute(new Subcommand(10)); //removes 10 from 10

## code reuse patterns
### abstract 'class' pattern:
			'class' A is a base 'class' whose only purpose is to create subclasses
			-you will never issue var blah = new thisClass{};
			-you will always issue class Blah extends thisClass {};

### subclassing pattern
		-inheriting properties for aa new object to a base / superclass object
		-class A = super class / base object
		-class B = subclass
		-class B extends class A () {...}
			1. all instances of B inherit methods from A
			2. B can override methods of A
			3. B can invoke methods of A that has been overridden (method chaining)
				-B overrides method 1, B can still call method 1 from A via method chaining
			4. B can invoke the constructor of A via constructor chaining

		basic workflow:
			1. inside subclass, call parent constructor via Parent.call(this,arg1, arg2,etc);
			2. immediately after subclass definition, set prototype inheritance, Subclass.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype)
		-extended example: ES5
				//define the base class
			var	Person = function( firstName , lastName ){
					this.firstName = firstName;
					this.lastName =  lastName;
					this.gender = 'male'
			}

			//a new instance of Person can then easily be created as follows:
			var clark = new Person( "Clark" , "Kent" );

			//Define a subclass constructor for for 'Superhero':
			var Superhero = function( firstName, lastName , powers ){
					/*
							Invoke the superclass constructor on the new object
							then use .call() to invoke the constructor as a method of
							the object to be initialized.
					*/
					Person.call(this, firstName, lastName);
					//Finally, store their powers, a new array of traits not found in a normal 'Person'
					this.powers = powers;
			}
			//assign the Person prototype to the Superhero prototype to ensure all methods are passed over
			Superhero.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
				//new X is Object.create(X.prototype) with additionally running the constructor function. (And giving the constructor the chance to return the actual object that should be the result of the expression instead of this.)
			var superman = new Superhero( "Clark" ,"Kent" , ['flight','heat-vision'] );
			console.log(superman); /* includes superhero props as well as gender*/

		-extended example: ES6
			class Person {
				constructor(props) {
					this.firstname = props.firstname,
					this.lastname = props.lastname,
					this.gender = props.gender || 'male'
				}
			}
			let noah = new Person('noah','hall');

### inheritance pattern:

### mixin pattern:
			-share methods across multiple objects/classes
			-take object A and mixin the methods/properties of object B
			-a mixin is a 'class' that contains methods 'for' use by other classes without having to be the parent 'class' of those other classes.

			-in jquery
				$.extend(TargetObject, source1, source2, ...);
					TargetObject gets functionality from source

			-example 2
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTNb4yo3S3c&list=PLrzrNeNx3kNHsaPfrpPo0AlW-MhJE6gOA&index=14
				function extend(target) {
					if (!arguments[1]) return; //multiple source objects can be sent in

					//copy source methods and props over to target
					for var (i = 1; i < arguments; i++){
						var source = arguments[i];
						for (var prop in source) {

							//only copy properties that the target does not have and that the source owns (no prototypical properties)
							if (!target[prop] && source.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
								target[prop] = source[prop]
							}
						}
					}
				}

			-example 1 from wikipedia
					//https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin
					var EnumerableFirstLast = (function () { // function based module pattern.
					    var first = function () {
					        return this[0];
					    },
					    last = function () {
					        return this[this.length - 1];
					    };
					    return function () {      // function based Flight-Mixin mechanics ...
					        this.first  = first;  // ... referring to ...
					        this.last   = last;   // ... shared code.
					    };
					}());

					// Application - explicit delegation:
					// applying [first] and [last] enumerable behavior onto [Array]'s [prototype].
					EnumerableFirstLast.call(Array.prototype);

					// Now you can do:
					a = [1, 2, 3];
					a.first(); // 1
					a.last();  // 3

### decorator pattern
			-wrapper used to extend functionality of an object without rewriting it
			-useful 'for' modifying existing systems where you may wish to add additional features to objects without the need to change the underlying code that uses them.
			-function A takes function B as an argument, before calling function B it has logic to see if it 'should' call function b

				-how functions are defined without decoration
						class Blah {
							someMethod() {
								return 'stuff';
							}
						}
						//is really this
						Object.defineProperty(Blah.prototype, 'meo', {
							value: specifiedFunction,
							enumerable: false,
							configurable: true,
							writable: true
						});

				-property decoration es6
					function readonly(target,key,descriptor) {
						descriptor.writable = false;
						return descriptor;
					}
					//use it like this
					class Blah {
						@readOnly
						someMethod() {
							return 'stuff';
						}
					}
				property decoration es5
					function AuthorizationDecorator(protectedFunction) {
					    return function() {
					        if (user.isTrusted()) {
					            protectedFunction();
					        } else {
					            console.log('Hey! No cheating!');
					        }
					    }
					}
					//Using it would look like this:
					AuthorizationDecorator(save);

### behavior patterns
		observer patterns:
			-defines an object (subject) that notifies other objects (observers) when its state changes
			-javascript and the DOM are implemented with the observer pattern
			-example
				document.addEventListener('click', function(evt){...});
				document = subject
				function = observer
				when the click happens, the document publishes the event to all its subscribers
			publish subscribe pattern:
				function pubSub() {
					var subscribers = {};

					//
					function subscribe(type, fn) {
						//type: event your subscribing to
						//fn: observer

						//if type array does not exist, add it
						if (!subscribers[type]) {
							subscribers[type] = [];
						}

						//if observer is not associated with type, then add it
						if(subscribers[type].indexOf(fn) == -1) {
							subscribers[type].push(fn)
						}
					}

					function unsubscribe(type, fn) {
						//get array of all observers of this type
						var listeners = subscribers[type];
						if(!listeners) return;

						//remove observers
						var index = listeners.indexOf(fn){
							if (index > -1) listeners.splice(index,1)
						}
					}
					function publish(type, evtObj) {
						if (!subscribers[type]) return;
						if(!evtObj.type) {
							evtObj.type = type;
						}

						//publish the event data to all observers
						var listeners = subscribers[type];
						for (var i=0;i.listeners.length;i++){
							listeners[i](evtObj)p
						}
					}

					return {
						subscribe: this.subscribe,
						unsubscribe: this.unsubscribe,
						publish: this.publish
					}
				}

				use pubsub:
					function observer1(evt){
						console.log('got observed evt', evt)
					}
					pubSub.subscribe('someEvent', observer1);
					pubSub.publish('someEvent',, {this:'is the evtObj'});
					pubSub.unsubscribe('someEvent', observer1)

### module patterns
		Basic pattern
			-you namespace your code in an immediately invoked function, so that it provides privacy to your real functionality, or some other functinoality
			-whatever you return is publicacly accessible
			-utilize functional scope and closures

			var someModule = (function($,bloop) {
				//$ = arg1, bloop = arg2 passed into the someModule

				//priv props and functions
				var privVar = 0;
				function privFunc() {
					return privVar + 1;
				}
				return {
					pubProp: function(){ return this.privVar },
					pubFunc: function(){ return this.privFunc()}
				}
			})(arg1, arg2));
			var someModule = {
				privProp: f
				someMeth: function(blah) {
					return 'duh';
				}
			}
			someModule.someMetho(boom);

		AMD format
			asynchronous module definition

debugging
	debugger; //pauses app run time at this point in the app.
		1. you can open up console and type in any of the variables in the app, and it will print to the console
		2. you can type in a function name and review it
		3. you can click through the sources panel and view different things

jsdocs
	takes code with /** */ comments and produces HTML documentation 'for' it
	http://www.2ality.com/2011/08/jsdoc-intro.html

	meta data 'for' the entire file
	/**
	  * @fileOverview HTML widget for displaying documentation about a reusable react component.
	  * @author <a href="mailto:noah.hall@dictionary.com">Noah Hall</a>
	  * @version 0.3.0
	  */

	giving an example of use
	/**
		* @example
	  * var str = "abc";
	  * console.log(repeat(str, 3)); // abcabcabc
	  */

	@see: points to a related resource.
		/**
		  * @see MyClass#myInstanceMethod
  	  * @see The <a href="http://example.com">Example Project</a>.
		  */


		{@link ...}: works like @see, but can be used inside other tags.
		@requires resourceDescription: a resource that the documented entity needs. The resource description is either a name path or a natural language description.

	documenting functions and methods: For functions and methods. describes the parameter whose name is paramName. Type and description are optional.
		@param {paramType} paramName description:
			@param str
	    @param str The string to repeat.
	    @param {string} str
	    @param {string} str The string to repeat.

		specify a param is optional and not require
			@param {number} [times] The number of times is optional

		specify a param is optional and display its default value
			@param {number} [times=1] The number of times is optional.

		specify the return of a function
			@returns {returnType} description: describes the return value of the function or method. Either type or description can be omitted.

		specify if this function throws any errors
			@throws {exceptionType} description: describes an exception that might be thrown during the execution of the function or method. Either type or description can be omitted.

	inline type information, i.e. inline doc comments
		There are two ways of providing type information for parameters and return values. First, you can add a type annotation to @param and @returns.
			/**
			 * @param {String} name
			 * @returns {Object}
			 */
			function getPerson(name) {
			}
		Second, you can inline the type information:
	    function getPerson(/**String*/ name) /**Object*/ {
	    }

	Documenting variables and fields: Fields are properties with non-function values. Because instance fields are often created inside a constructor, you have to document them there.
		specify the type of a variable
			@type {typeName}: What type does the documented variable have? Example:
			/** @constructor */
			function Car(make, owner) {
					/** @type {string} */
					this.make = make;

					/** @type {Person} */
					this.owner = owner;
			}
			@type {Person}

		specify a constant
			@constant: A flag that indicates that the documented variable has a constant value.

		specify variable default value
			@default defaultValue: What is the default value of a variable? Example:
				/** @constructor */
				function Page(title) {
						/**
						 * @default "Untitled"
						 */
						  this.title = title || "Untitled";


	Document an instance property in the class comment. Example:
		@property {propType} propName description
    /**
     * @class
     * @property {string} name The name of the person.
     */
    function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }


	@constructor: marks a function as a constructor.
	@class: marks a variable as a class or a function as a constructor. Can be used in a constructor comment to separate the description of the constructor (first line below) from the description of the class (second line below).
	    /**
	     * Creates a new instance of class Person.
	     * @class Represents a person.
	     */
	    Person = function() {
	    }



	documenting classes: JavaScript’s built-in means for defining classes are weak, which is why there are many APIs that help with this task [5]. These APIs differ, often radically, so you have to help JSDoc with figuring out what is going on. There are three basic ways of defining a class:

		Constructor function: You must mark a constructor function, otherwise it will not be documented as a class. That is, capitalization alone does not mark a function as a constructor.
			/**
			 * @constructor
			 */
			function Person(name) {
			}

		API call and object literal: You need two markers. First, you need to tell JSDoc that a given variable holds a class. Second, you need to mark an object literal as defining a class. The latter is done via the @lends tag.
				/** @class */
				var Person = makeClass(
						/** @lends Person# */
						{
								say: function(message) {
										return "This person says: " + message;
								}
						}
				);

	toString()	Converts a number to a string
	valueOf()	Returns the primitive value of a number
	Number.isSafeInteger(n); //ES6
	isNaN(19) // returns false, because 19 is anumber
	isNaN('nineteen') //return strue, because nineteen is a string

variable section
	var x;
	var x = 5

	shortcut assignment
		var blah = someOtherVar || '';
			//this way blah will always have a value
			//reduces the possibility of errors if someOtherVar has not been set
	notes
		defining variables without the keyword var turns them into global variables
			EVEN INSIDE FUNCTINONS!
		variables & functions are hoisted!
			i.e. if you define a variable at the bottom of the page, the javascript interpreter will move the declaration to the top of the current scope

array section
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/
	var blah = [];
	var blah = [1,2,3];
	var blah = new Array();
	var blah = Array();
	var blah = Array(5);
	var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
	var name = cars[0];
	cars[0] = "Opel";

	properties
		blah.length //how many items

	methods
		concat()	Joins two or more arrays, and returns a copy of the joined arrays
		indexOf()	Search the array for an element and returns its position
		join()	Joins all elements of an array into a string
		lastIndexOf()	Search the array for an element, starting at the end, and returns its position
		pop()	Removes the last element of an array, and returns that element
		push()	Adds new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length
		reverse()	Reverses the order of the elements in an array
		shift()	Removes the first element of an array, and returns that element
		slice()	Selects a part of an array, and returns the new array
		sort([compareFunction])	Sorts the elements of an array
			function compare(a, b) { //sort letters from a-z
			  if (a < b) {
			    return -1;
			  }
			  if (a>b) {
			    return 1;
			  }
			  return 0;
			}

			function compareNumbers(a, b) { //numbers ascending
			  return a - b;
			}
		splice(start, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]])	Adds/Removes elements from an array, item1,itemX will be added
			If you specify a different number of elements to insert than the number youre removing, the array will have a different length at the end of the call.
		toString()	Converts an array to a string, and returns the result
		unshift()	Adds new elements to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length
		valueOf()	Returns the primitive value of an array
		map(callback) apply the function to each item in the array
			callback(item,index,thisArr)
		filter(callback[, thisArg]) The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
			callback(item,index,thisArr)
		some(functionName) The some() method tests whether some element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. if any element returns true, it returns true
		reduce(callback[, initialValue]) method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.
			[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(function(previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) {
  				return previousValue + currentValue;
			});
		every(callback[, thisArg]) tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
			callback(item, index, array)
			https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every

	code examples
		extend array to find max number if all items are number-like
			Array.prototype.max = function(){
			  var newArr = this.filter(Number);
			  if (newArr.length == this.length){
			    return Math.max.apply(null, this);
			  }
			  return NaN;
			}

			better version of the above using ES6
				Array.prototype.max = function() {
				  return Math.max(...this);
				}

			or you can apply it directly to the arr and assume all items are numbers
				Math.max.apply(null, numArray);

    remove a single element from array
      someArray.splice(i, 1); //i = index of element to remove

		use reduce to modify an array and add each array item as an item in an object
			someArr.reduce(function(o, v, i){
			    return o[v] = i in values ? values[i] : null, o;
			  }, {});

		insert item into array at index
			arr.splice(index, 0, item);

		create an array of numbers from 0 to someInteger (e.g. [0,1,2,etc])
			Array.apply(null, Array(someInteger)).map(function (_, i) {return i;});

		If you need to remove ALL empty values ("", null, undefined and 0):
			arr = arr.filter(function(e){return e});
		To remove empty values and Line breaks:
			arr = arr.filter(function(e){ return e.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,"")});
		In some situations you may want to keep "0" in the array and remove anything else (null, undefined and ""), this is one way:
			arr.filter(function(e){ return e === 0 || e });

object section
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object
	notes
		can contain any type of object, even other objects

	var blah = {'this':'that','this':'that'}
	var blah {
		'myFunction':function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;},
		'otherObject' : {
			'item1': 'sometext'
		}
	}

	associate functions with objects
		function someFunction(){
			console.log(this);
		};

		var blah = {};
		blah.someMethod() = someFunction;
			this associtiates the method on the object, with a predefined function
			make sure the function uses the keyword 'this' so it can be used with
			multiple objects

	access object properties
		objectName.propertyName
		objectName["propertyName"]
		objectName.methodName()

	code examples
		apply any array method to an object
			//this gets ALL properties, even those on its prototype & contructor
			Object.keys(myObject).map(function(value, index) {
			   myObject[value] *= 2;
			});
			Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObject) //only gets its own properties

control section
	try catch

		try {
			/*code*/
		} catch (err){
			/*
				err.message == message of error
			*/
		}finally {
			/*do this regardless of what happens*/
		}

	if statements
		if (condition1) {
		    block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
		} else if (condition2) {
		    block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
		} else {
		    block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
		}

	switch statements
		switch(expression) {
		    case n:
		        code block
		        break;
		    case n:
		        code block
		        break;
		    default:
		        default code block
		}

loop section
	The break statement breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop (if any):
	The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

	for loop
		var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
		for	(index = 0; index < fruits.length; index++) {
		    text += fruits[index];
		}

	for in loops
		var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};
		var text = "";
		var x;
		for (x in person) {
		    text += person[x];
		}

	while loop
		index =100
		while (index--) {
			//index in here will start at 99, since you used index-- as the condition
		    code block to be executed
		}

	do while loop
		do {
		    code block to be executed
		}
		while (condition);

function section
	function parameters are variables that are local to the function
	functions can return anything, even other functions

	notes
		arguments = an array-like OBJECT containing all of the parameters passed to the function. it is NOT AN Array

			function blah(){
				//arguments[0], arguments[1], etc contains all the args passed in
				// you dont need to have a parameter declared,
			}

			convert it to an array:
				var args = (arguments.length === 1?[arguments[0]]:Array.apply(null, arguments));
			call an arrays method on arguments object
				Array.every.call(arguments, function(value){ return this stuff;})


		this = the calling scope, either an object, or the window global object

	function declaration
		function myFunction(){
			/*do this stuff*/
		}

		function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
		    code to be executed
		}

		myFunction();

	definition expressions (i.e. anonymous function)
		var myFunction = function(a,b) {
			//do some stuff
		}

		can be executed immediately
		var myFunction = function(a,b){
			return a+b;
		}(2,2);

	save data in a function after every call
		function saveThis(data) {
		 this.save = this.save || []; //create a new array only on the first call
		 if (this.save[data]) return this.save[data]; //return the data if it exists
		 return this.save[data] = data; //save new data on each call
		}
	anonymous enclosures
		(function(arg1,arg2){
			//wrap the anonymous function in paranthesis
			//then call the function immediately by ending wtih () and send in parameters
			//any variables declared inside this function are local to this function

		})(par1, par2);
	using call and apply to control 'this' and 'arguments' inside a function
		functionName.call(someOBject, someParameter)
			someObject becomes the value of 'this' inside of the function
			someParameter becomes the parameter passed to the function

		functionNAme.apply(someObject ['someArrayElement'])
			same as the above, only the function parameter is passed as an array

	functions fired on events
		<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

	function closures: defining a function within a function

prototypes and constructors and 'class' section
	notes
		helps you create formalized objects (i.e. classes)
		its simply a function that creates an object
		new = the constructor operator, creates a new instance of an object
		prototype object allows you to extend functions functionality after its created

	function ClassConstructor(n) {
		this.name = n;

	}

	var instance = new ClassConstructor('fred');

	use prototype to attach new methods/vars to the constructor
		ClassConstructor.prototype.blah = function(){
			console.log('this.name', 'is my name.');
		}

	get the original prototype function
		Object.getPrototypeOf(someFunctionHere);

	code examples
		create a class that uses another classes methods (this example uses arrays)
			var Queue = function() {
			  this._array = [];
			};
			Queue.prototype.enqueue = function(item) {
			  this._array.push(item);
			};
			Queue.prototype.dequeue = function() {
			  return this._array.shift();
			};
			Queue.prototype.size = function() {
			  return this._array.length; // the size of the queue
			};

Modules & namespacing
	Modules: allow you to reuse code across apps
	Namespacing: allows you to protect your variable names from the global scope
		assign a self executing function to a variable
		and use a return statement within the self executing function to return an object containing the variables & methods you want to use]
	Chaning module method calls
		as long as you return 'this' then you can chain methods

	var myModule = (function(){ //module here can be the same thing as a namespace
		var DEFAULTS = {
			firstArg: 'blah',
			secondArg: 'bloop'
		}
		return {
			run: function(){
				var firstArg = arguments[0] || DEFAULTS.firstArg; //use the first truthy
				console.log(firstArg);
				return this; //allow method chaining by returning the object itself
			},
			speak: function(){
				var secondArg = arguments[1] || DEFAULTS.secondArg; //use the first truthy
				console.log(secondArg);
				return this; //allow method chaining by returning the object itself
			}
		};
	})();
	myModule.speak(); //call the speak function inside of myModule anywhere in your application

	name spaces & classes examples: define a name space and a class, with a class function 'sayHello'
		example 1
			var MyNamespace = MyNamespace || {}; //dont create a new one if it already exists
			MyNamespace.MyClass = function(phrase){
			  this.phrase = phrase;
			};
			MyNamespace.MyClass.prototype.sayHello = function(){
			  return this.phrase;
			};

		example 2
			var MyNamespace = MyNamespace || {}; //dont create a new one if it already exists
			MyNamespace.MyClass = function(msg) {
			  this.msg = msg;
			  this.sayHello = function() {
			    return this.msg;
			  };
			};

event section
	notes
		Javascript runs code sequentially (top to bottom), however Javascript related to events will run when the event happens
		Event Registration: telling javascript you want to react to specific events when they happen via an event handler
			1. using tag attributes
				onclick="alert('show this message on click')"
			2. using dot notation
				document.getElementById('blah').onclick=function(){alert('show this message on click');}
			3. using addEventListener()
				it allows us to check for multiple events in a single call (aka event propagation)
				and events can be triggered via non DOM objects (i.e. write your own events)
				it is not supported by IE 8 or lower (you have to use an if statement to check for the other one)

				without jQuery
					if (window.addEventListener){
						document.getElementById('blah').addEventListener('click', function(e){ //e is a placeholder for the event object
							alert('show this message on click')
						}, false); //false = bubbling (more compatible), true = capturing
					}else if (window.attachEvent){
						document.getElementById('blah').attachEvent('onclick',function(e){ //e is a placeholder for the event object
							alert('show this message on click');
						});
					}
				with jQuery
					$('#blah').on('click', function(event){
						alert('show this message on click');
					});

	Event objects
		capturing an event returns an event object
		event objects will be different in each browser, console log it to see:
			event info
				type = e.g. click
				timestamp = the time it happened
				defaultPrevented = if you are preventing the default behavior
			event targeting info
				currentTarget = the element the event was assigned to
				target = the element the event originated from
				srcElement = the actuall element that fired the event
				fromElement = mouse over and mouse out events
				toElement = mouse over and mouse event events
			coordinate info:
				screen X,Y: position relative to the users screen
				layer x, y: position relative to the another positioned event
				client x,y: position relative to the window
				page x,y: position relative to the document
				offset x,y: position relative to the element that fired the event
			key/mouse info
				charCode/Keycode: which character was pressed
				altKey:
				shiftKey:
				ctrlKey:
				button:

	Event propagation
		a parent event can capture events from is child elements
			only available when using addEventListener

		capturing phase: moves down from parent to child element
		bubbling phase: moves up from child to parent element

		stopping propoagation
			e.stopPropoagation()
				//stop the event from moving up/down the DOM
				//use this after you're done with the event


	Event Default behavior
		clicking on links, submitting forms, etc.
			e.preventDefault() //stops the default behavior

	examples
		removing elements
			document.querySelector('.blah').addEventListener('click', function(e){
				var removeTarget = e.target.parentNode;
				removeTarget.parentNode.removeChild();
			})

	onchange	An HTML element has been changed
	onclick	The user clicks an HTML element

	writing into the browser console, using console.dir().

DOM
	nodes
		nodes represent elements, comments, text, comments, etc.
			there are 12 node types, most important are element, attribute, and text
				ul= element node
				ul#myId = attribute node
				<ul id='myId'><li>some text</li></ul> text displayed to client is always inside of a text node

	checking node types
		someVar.nodeType
			1 = element
			2 = attribute
			3 = text

	grabbing elements
		var myelement = document.GetElementById('idname');
			getElementById can be used at any level, not just the document level
			e.g. if you grab a UL, you can use getElementsByTagName to grab its child li tags
		var myelement = document.getElementsByTagName('p'); //returns an array containing 0/more elements


	working with attributes
		myelemen.getAttribute('attributename');
		myelement.setAttribute('attributename', 'attributevalue');


	change html content
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";


	change html styles (CSS)
		document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";

	creating element and inserting elements into the DOM
		var newElement = document.createElement('li');
		var newText = document.createTextNode('add this text');
		newElement.appendChild(newText);
		otherElement.appendChild(newElement);

	good tricks
		window.onload = function() {
			do stuff once the entire page has loaded

		}

		DOM Section
		    document object model
		    hierarchical relationship between objects on the webpage
		        document
		                head
		                body
		    accessing the DOM is done with an API:
		        document: the root of the page
		        element: a node in the document tree
		        nodeList: an array (group) of elements
		            document.getElementByTagName('p') #returns a nodeList
		        attribute: a node in the DOM, usually a child of an element

		        APIs
		            document.getElementById('id')
		            document.getElementsByClassName('class')
		            element.innerHTML
		            element.style
		            element.setAttribute(attribute,value)
		            element.removeAttribute(attribute)

		    display data to the user
		        alert('your message') //give user information
		        prompt('your question') //ask user for information
		        document.write('your html') //rewrite the entire page
		        element.innerHTML = 'Your Text' //add text to an element
		        console.log('your message') //writes tot he console during program execution

timers
	setTimeout(someFunctionName, milliseconds); //runs someFunctionName ONCE after X milliseconds
	setInterval(someFunctionName, milliseconds); //runs someFunctionName EVERY X milliseconds
	clearInterval(intervalHandle) //you must assign setInterval to a variable
	clearTimeout(timeoutHandle) //you must assign setTimeout to a variable

setting CSS
	someelement.style.property = value
		any property wtih hyphens (e.g. background-color) becomes camel case (e.g. backgroundColor)
		to access the elements class, you have to use somelement.style.className

AJAX
	javascript can communicate to a server, retrieve data, and update parts of a page

	steps
		1. create the request
		2. prepare to accept a response
		3. deal wtih any reponse

	//create the request
	var myRequest;
	if (window.XMLhttpRequest){ //firefox, safari, chrome, etc.
		myRequest = newXMLHttpRequest();
	}else if (window.ActiveXObject){ //IE
		myRequest = newActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
	}

	//preparate to accept a response via an event handler
	myRequest.onreadystatechange = function(){
		//do some stuff with the response
	}

	//configure and send the request
	myRequest.open("GET", "url/to/get/data/from", true);
	myRequest.send(null); //instead of null, you can actually pass some data

	properties of the request
		myRequest.readyState //an integer, use it to control the flow
			4 = got a response back
		myRequest.responseText //the response from teh call

number section
	Number()	Returns a number, converted from its argument.

javascript: using APIs
	HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol:
		hypertext = text with links
		transfer protocol: rules for moving things across the web

	clients: asks (requests) servers for resources
	servers: store information and sends (response)
	REST: Representational State transfer
		state transition: going from one state (page) to another (page)
		1. separate client from server
		2. not hold state between requests (all information is sent with each response)
		3. use HTTP and HTTP methods
	API: application programming interface: specifies the ways a program can interact with an application

		Endpoints: API-defined locations where specific data-types are stored


	HTTP Requests:
		1. Request: tells the server what kind of request (method) is being sent
			// POST /codecademy/learn-http HTTP/1.1
		2. Header: sends the server additional information, e.g. which client is making the request
			// Host: www.codecademy.com
			// Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
		3. body: contains the data being sent
			GET: body = empty
			POST/UPDATE/DELETE: body should not be empty
				// Name=Eric&Age=26


	HTTP Responses:
		Status Codes: three digits, the starting number defines the type
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
			1xx: information
			2xx: success
			3xx: redirection
			4xx: client error
			5xx: server error
			6xx: unoficial Codes
				6.1: internet information services
				6.2: nginx
				6.3: cloudfare
		Anotomy:
			01: response line: includes the 3 digit http status code
				// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
			02: header line: information about the server and response
				// Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8
			03: body: contains the text of the response
				// <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
				// ..
				// ..it just continues depending on the size of data returned

	commands
		var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); //make requests with an instance
		xhr.open("METHOD", "SERVER", false); //setup the request
			METHOD:
				GET: retrieves information
				POST: sends information
				PUT: updates existing information
				DELETE: removes existing information
		xhr.send(); //send the request

		Parsing XML
			xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
			xhr.send();
			var xmlDocument = xhr.responseXML

jquery

	jquery ui progress bar
		http://www.lynda.com/jQuery-tutorials/Progressbar-control/186963/368829-4.html


	basics

	// A $( document ).ready() block.
	$( document ).ready(function() {
			console.log( "ready!" );
	});
	selectors & filters
		used to select parts of the webpage using a common CSS style stynax
		-returns an array of matching items

		Syntax	Description	Example
		$("*")	Selects all elements
		$(this)	Selects the current HTML element
		$("p.intro")	Selects all <p> elements with class="intro"
		$("p:first")	Selects the first <p> element
		$("ul li:first")	Selects the first <li> element of the first <ul>
		$("ul li:first-child")	Selects the first <li> element of every <ul>
		$("[href]")	Selects all elements with an href attribute
		$("a[target='_blank']")	Selects all <a> elements with a target attribute value equal to "_blank"
		$("a[target!='_blank']")	Selects all <a> elements with a target attribute value NOT equal to "_blank"
		$(":button")	Selects all <button> elements and <input> elements of type="button"
		$("tr:even")	Selects all even <tr> elements
		$("tr:odd")	Selects all odd <tr> elements


		filters
			used to further refine the results from selectors

			$("p:first") grabs the first paragraph tag
			$("h2:not(.class)") grabs all h2 tags that do not have class="class"

			additional filters
				:first, :list
				:even, :odd
				:gt(), :lt(), :eq() #pass in javascript indexes
				:animated #items currently being animated
				:focus
				:not(expr) #elements that do not match the given expression
					$("p:not(p:eq(2))") #paragraphs that are not equal to index 2
					-uses regular selectors & filters as the expression

		advanced selectors
			$("blah > blah") # > is a child selector, so only select level 1 child elements
			$(blah blah2) #select all blah2 that are an ancestor (no matter level) of blah
			$(blah + blah2) #select all blah2 that come immediately after blah
			$(blah ~ blah2) #select all blah2 that are siblings (come after) blah

		advanced (attribute) filters
			$("p[class]") #select all paragraphs that have a class attribute
			$("p[class=1]") #select all paragraphs that have a class attribute set to 1
			$("p[class^=1]") #select all paragraphs that have a class atttribute whose value starts with 1
			$("p[class^=1][lang*=en]") #select all paragraphs that have a class attribute whos value start with 1, AND whose lang attribute has a value that contains en

			$("p:contains('sometext')") #select all paragraphs that contains 'sometext' as text content, i.e. not empty
			$("p:parent") #select all paragraphs that have child elements or text content
			$("p:has(span[class=blah])") #select all paragraphs that have a child span element with the class attribute set to blah

			$("div p:first-child") #select all paragraphs that are the first child of a div tag
			$("div p:last-of-type") #select all paragraphs that are the last child paragraph of a div
			$("div p:nth-child(3)") #select all paragraphs that are the third child of a div #not index based
			$("div p:nth-child(2n)") #select every second paragraph that is a child of a div #not index based

	CSS
		$(blah).css("property", "value")

	creating HTML
		var newP = $("<p>"); #create new paragraph
		$("someelement").append("<div>blah</div>") #adds a new div with blah text at the end of somelement

	traversing html
		$(blah).next() #select blahs next sibling element
		$(blah).prev() #select blahs previous sibling
		$(blah).parent()
		$(blah).parents() #select all of blah's parent's elements
		$(blah).parentsUntil($("body")) #select all of blahs parents that are child elements of the body element
		$(blah).children() #return an array of all of blahs immediate children (no grand children, etc.)
			.children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level
			down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant
			elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well. Note also that like most jQuery methods,
			.children() does not return text nodes; to get all children including text and comment
			nodes, use .contents().

		$(blah).find("#blah2") find the descendent (including grandchildren) element of blah
		>that has an id of blah2 (includin)

	functions
		$("blah").ready(your function);
			once blah is ready to be operated on, it will run 'your function'

			$("document").ready(function() { yourfunctionhere; });

		$("blah").onload(your function);
			once blah has been loaded (images, and everything) it will run 'your function', slower than .ready

		$("blah").append("your item");
			adds 'blah' as the last child of blah

		$("blah").prepend("your item");
			inserts  your item as the first child of blah

		$("blah").html("blah2")
			replaces the content of blah with blah2

		$("blah").text("escaped code");
			will insert escaped code as PLAIN TEXT, thus any code will be readable as text and not executed
		$("blah").focusout() method is just a shorthand for .on( "focusout", handler ), detaching is possible using .off( "focusout" ).

	statement chaining
		$(blah).function1().function2().etc

	loops
		$(blah).each(function(index, element)){your code}
			#loop over each blah and do something to it
			#index = index of current item
			#element = the current element
			#inside the code, use $(element) to turn the current element into a jquery object that can accept jquery functionsvar images = $("img");

	events
		$("p").click();
		$("blah").on("mousemove", yourfunction);
			.on binds a function to a specific event
		$("blah").off("mousemove", yourfunction);
			.off unbinds a function from a specific event

			function yourfunction(evt){
				 evt.type
				 evt.pageX
				 evt.pageY
				 evt.metaKey
					research other properties of the evt object that is passed by event listeners
			}

		$("blah").trigger("event")

		evt
			an event object that jquery uses to send event information to functions

			evt.type #type of event, e.g. click
			evt.pageX #x coordinates of the mouse
			evt.pageY #y coordinates of the mouse



		more events
			Mouse
			click
			keypress
			submit
			load
			dblclick
			keydown
			change
			resize
			mouseenter
			keyup
			focus
			scroll
			mouseleave
			blur
			unload



	animations
		$("blah").animate({property: newvalue}, timeinmilliseconds);
		$("blah").animate({property: "+=100"}, "slow");
		$("blah").animate({propert1: value1, property2:value2}, timeinmilliiseconds)

	ajax
		ajax(): used to perform generic ajax requests
		load(): loads ajax content directly into a page elmeent

		ajax:
			make a request to the server for content
			parse the content
			and load it in the browser

		$.ajax(
			"www.blah.com/somefile.php",
			{success: yoursuccessfunction, type: "GET", dataType: "text"}
		);
			url to call
			succesS: the success function to call
			type: the HTTP type, e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE, etc
			data: the type of data your expecting to be returned

			function yoursuccessfunction (data, status, jqxhr){
				$("blah").text(data);
				$("blah").text(status);
				$("blah").text(jqxhr);
			}

				data: the data returned from the ajax call
				status: the status of the ajax call
				jqxhr: the xml http request object

			second way to load content from the server

				$("blah").load("www.blah.com/somefile.php")
					load will make the ajax request, retrieve the data, and load it into the php

	jquery UI
		interactions: interactive behavior to apply to page elements
		widgets: UI interface controls
		Effects: visual effects to use in applications

		adding jquery UI
			include the style sheet
				<link rel="styleeshett" href="/path/to/style.css" />
			include the jquery js
				<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery.js"></script>
			include the jquery ui library: must be loaded after jquery
