- [nimlang moved to bookofnim](https://github.com/noahehall/nim)
- [racexp moved to nirvai](https://github.com/nirv-ai/racexp)

  - javascript > web architecture > virtualization > bash > databases > nimlang > security
  - i spend too much time at the top, and not enough at the bottom of the stack
  - but thats just how life goes
