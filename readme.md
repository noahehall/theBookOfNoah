  - started as notes to various things i've learned in my career
  - is now becomming a bible of sorts
  - by keeping these notes, every time I return to a particular topic, I can quickly ramp up to where i left off, and continue later, forever increasing my understanding and updating obsolete information
  - I generally start with my notes before searching the internet to keep the cycle of learn -> do -> repeat in motion
