# TODO
## ALPHA - first steps
  - sit down and play a game for at least a half-hour
    - write a brief summry of the experience
  - watch a sequence from a film or television show and list each element of it.
    - how did the scene begin, how did it end, what cinematic language tricks were used to shorthand information to you
  - take a franchise you engoy from games, film, television or books
    - write down five iconic franchise elements that come to mind when you think of it
  - tame your favorite game of today and image it designed to run on technology from the early days of video games
    - what elements of the game could be implemented
      - would it be fun ?
      - would it be good ?
    - if you dont believe your favorite game could trasnlate back in time, why?
  - identify the core conflict of a story
    - using the main types of conflict, write a page that describes the core conflict of your favorite game, film, television show or book
    - consider it carefully, often the obvious conflict  is masking something deeper
      - e.g. a man at war with the world may actually be lashing out at society becaause he is really at war with himself
    - what is the core conflict of the experience?
    - how does this conflict manifest itself in gameplay?
    - this will become the foundation of both your game and story content
  - up the stakes
    - write a sequence of events in which the stakes keep escalating
    - think about the affect stakes have on your story
  - player/character relationship
    - play a game with a hero, studying how you feel about your relationship with the character
    - do you feel like
      - you have become the charactor?
      - more like a sidekick?
      - a god?
    - is the action of the game happening to you or the character your controlling?
    - do you care about the charactor or only their predicament?

## BETA - second steps
  - tell a bedtime story to a small child, make it up, embellish it wildly.
    - writing down your thoguhhts about the experience
      - what worked ?
      - what didnt ?
      - did inspiration hit? if so think about how
      - do you think you could do it again?
  - write out three versions of the same gameplay sequence using the play it, display it, say it model
    - create each possible solution
      - e.g. a hero blows up a door
        - a version it happens in gameplay
        - a version it happens in a narrative
        - a version where the hero recounts blowing up the door to someone else
  - your day in voice-over
    - think about what you did yesterday: where you went, who you met, what you had for lunch etc.
    - were there any specific tasks you had to accomplish? go to the mall, school, meeting, etc
    - in essence, turn yourself into a video game character and let the player in on your thoughts
      - make sure you include enouggh information needed so that someone else would be able to make the same logical choices you did as your day played out
      -
    -

## GOLD - final steps
  - using your idea for a game - write a setup and payoff narrative sequence
    - think about what the sequences must convey to the player
    -
# quotes
  - embrace the potential chaos because that is often where real inspiration is discovered
  - we are not so arrogant as to believe that ours is the only way. if there were a sure path to success then this would be easy
  - every situation demands its own unique mix of strategies and tactics
  - often the most innovative ideas come not from constantly pushing the envelope, but from looking at the envelopoe in a new way oor using it to do something completely unexpected
    - creativity need not and in fact should not, rely on constantly advancing technology
    -

# definitions
  - franchise
    - an entertainment propery that trascends medium
    - e.g. games, film, tv, books, costumes, collectables, identical
  - game designer
    - responsibile for all of the creative content in the game
    - characters, worlds, core gameplay, level layout and design, core mechanics, weapons, player character abilities, story, usable objects, inventory systems, game-shells, controls, etc
  - game writer
    - primarily concerned with the narrative content of the title and how it integrates into gameplay
      - the story, characters, worls, mythologies, creatures, enemies, mystical powers, grounded or enhanced realities, technologies, identical

# characters
  - characters and story give the player something they can invest in emotionally
  - keep the hero *in character*
    - he is the hero, dont make him the weakest character (and have to level up)
  - the hero should be proactive, instead of reactive
  - the more role playing a game has
    - the more the player determines who their character is
    - the less applicable the character can be licensed/franchised
      - e.g. DC comics will not allow ANY version of a superman game in which the man of still is allowed to kill civilians
  - the hero does not have to be the protagonist
    - they can have their own inner-tension and turmoil, not just that which is generated within the game
  - player expectations
    - think of character, world, tone and theme as the cornerstones of your story
    - to build your narrative, your going to add plot that is driven by conflict and stakes, and in the process put your hero at risk
    - the risk generates the dramatic tension of the story
    - if people care about your character, a lot will be forgiven

# WORLD
  - not only the location, but also the reality in which the story takes place


# TONE
  - is it light, heaavy, serious, playful, black, irreverent?
  - the tone is set within the narrative that the player becomes comfortable with

# THEME
  - underneath the game story is the theme:
    - redemption, salvation, falling from grace, power corrupts, money cant buy happiness,
  - all of the cliches tend to be the big themes that fuel the story
  - the importance of understanding the theme of yor story cannot be overstated
  - what scenes do you need in order to advance the hero forward in a way that will deliver the theme?


# GAMES
  - we believe games can be both interactive entertainment and a compelling medium in which to tell stories and develop characters
  - games are exciting experiences we share and talk about
    - they can, and do have an impact and leave an impression often in waays traditional entertainment cant
    - because when we play a game we are active participants in the process
  - elements of a great game
    - an interesting world
    - a great plot with twist and turns, setups and payoffs
    - compelling characters that are affected by and create the conflict and stakes
    - an immersive style that depends as much on the entire game experience as it does on the story
    - great challenges (manifested in gameplay) that you encounter and overcome

## game survival commandments
  - were in the entertainment business, not the game business
  - build your design and story to break
    - multiple technical and production realitities will stress your game design and story, things will be left in the trash bin, get in front of them as fast as possible
  - somebody always knows something you dont
    - learn from everyone you work with
  - dialogue is the tip of the dramatic iceberg
    - throwing dialogue at a broken story never fixes the problem
    - good dialogue and stories come from well-conceived characters in exciting dramatic situations
  - you are only as good as your relationship with your team
  - be willing to kill your babies
    - dont be precious with your ideas, or fall in love with oe particular because it will, almost without fail, be the one on the chopping block
  - protect your vision
    - if you lose your vision for a project or lose what waas meaningful about it that inspired you in the first place, then whats the pont of doing it
  - make your deliverables
    - you are only as good as what you contribute
  - choose collaboration over compromise
    - collaborating gets you to the same place as compromise, but without the negativity
  - making fun should be fun

## game types
  -
### story driven
  - action/adventure
  - first-person shooter
  - survival/horror
  - platformers
  - fantasy rpg
    - has a multitude of mutations and variants
  - mission based game
    - a kind of open-world design in whihc you are able to wander around all you want
    - but there are mandatory/optional missions that pin you to a sense of story progression
  - free flow game
    - there are no cinematics or obvious breaks in the story
    - this effectively refers to an open world design in whihc your adventure is whatever you happen to do in the world
    - there is no clear sequence of events
  - consequential story
    - a way to balance free flow and structure
    - the idea here is that the world is alive and rmeemvers things and there are consequences for your actions
  - role-playing game
    - you are not so much progressing through a story as trying to build up your character to better deal with the world of the games
    - so the journey of the character becomes the Story


# Story telling
  - when you are creating content for an interactive medium, there are expectations on the part of your audience
    - to be engaged
    - to be in control
      - in real life control is an illusion, or at best a temporary condition
    - to be playing
  - all of your writing and design is influenced and informed by the medium in which it will be ultimately be delivered
  - the story and gameplay should blend together seamlessly into a compelling experience:; story-related set-piece often make for good gameplay
    - the story works in unison with gameplay
  - narrative priority
    - in games, you can play it, display it, or say it
      - you have to prioritize your narrative do it in a certain order
  - oftentimes the needs of the game conflict with the needs of the story
  - the best advice for story progression in a game is to design it like a roller coaster
    - exhilaration
    - slowing
    - building suspense
    - bigger exhilaration
    - surprise bump
    - huge suspense
    - final wild ride
    - victory llap
    - get off the ride
    - notes
      - we are focusing on our characters, the world, and the gameplay challanges that the player will face as he accomplishes the objectives of the levels
      - once the above are in place, you can turn back to more traditional story telling techniques to create the narrative arc of the game
  - the story in games is doing more than simply existing as a story
    - helps too create a fully realized experience for the player
  - always write in the present tense, as if you are witnessing it in real time
  - story physics
    - the physics of game story break down to
      - action/reaction/action/react; escalating tensions; foreshadowing and reveals
    -


## types of stories
  - nonlinear story
    - set pieces are created that may live on their own, or when added to other set pieces build toward a larger unfolding narrative

  - metastory
    - closesly related to world
    - it is stuff that happens on the edges of your stories, things implied but never explicitly stated
  - linear
    - linear story drives the player through the game
    - linear path games are controllable
    - in a linear path you are given no choice as to what you do in the story
      - success/failure is dependent on whether you are able to accomplish preset goals
    - you dont have to think about the five thousand different things a play will do and cover every contingency
    - you know where he is, what hes doing and why hes doing it all times

### story styles
  - episodic
    - a series of episodes that does not add up to a story
    - eg. the cosby show which basically hits a reset at the beginning of every show
    - e.g. selling a game one level at a time (e.g. online) as opposed to selling one giant game product
  - film style
    - you take the structure of an action film and use the game parts to play the action sequences
    - use cinematics to mimic the dialogue scenes in the movie and maybe a few big payoffs
  - serial
    - inbetween episodic and film style
    - you are following a distinct story that ends in one level and then teases ou at the end of the level with a cliffhanger that leads you to the next level
  -


## types of branching narratives
  - branching narratives
    - like branches of a tree
    - the trunk forms the spine of the story
    - events within the narrative reach outward in a number of different directions at specific decision points, or branches, along the story
  - limited branching
    - tend to revolve around a series of yes/no or black/white objectives
    - depending on the outcome or choice of action that a player takes the game will branch to the appropriate story thread.
    - usually only go one/two branches deep before it returns to the main story arc
    - can lead to more than one ending
  - open-ended
    - are complex and ambitious and can quickly get out of hand
    - the player may be faced with a multitude of storylines to follow in the game, and each of these may have multiple permeations
    - creators often devote incredible amounts of creative energy, time and money to elements of the game and the story will not be seen because players takes an alternative branch and misses it
  - funneling narrative (chokepoints)
    - you have a controllable and definable way to set the player back on the narrative arc of the game by via funneling down a certain paith, or forcing down a specific path (chokepoint)
    - you give the player freedom to explore but ultimately you can elegantly determine where and when you will allow story and game progression to take place
    - e.g.
      - players can move throughout the environment and explore multiple story threads but they will not progress deeper into the game until they visit the bartender at the edge of town
  - critical paths
    - has one success path and allows the player to deviate from it in very small waays
    - however nothing of onsequence in the game or story happens outside of a predetermined path that winds its way through the experience
  - nodal storytelling
    - are either location and/or objective dependent.
    - each node of the game story is  a self-contained piece with a setup, midpoint and payoff
    - in totality, each of these story nodes may lleaad to a larger reveal or they may be just cool things that you play and see on your journey through the game
    - used by many open-environment games
    -

### cut scenes
  - setups
    - narratives are often used to setup the challenges that the hero will face in a paraticular level, or sometimes even a set piece within the level.
  - payoffs
    - aka attaboys
    - a narrative equivalent of a slap on the back
    - often they are the most visual sequences
      - e.g. when the bridge blows up as our hero jumpts to safety
  - autopsy
    - used to show the player where they made a mistake
  - advancement
    - similar too payoffs but on a larger scale
    - advancement cut-scenes establish new worlds/technology/characters/weapons/etc that the hero has earned by progressing forward through the game
  - character journeys
    - in the game, the character is creating the journey for his character as he plays
    - the story can support this with a specific scene that shows how the character is evolving, getting more powerful or wiser, or even more damaged
  - impart information (mission briefing)
    - when you need to creatively tell the player what he needs to accomplish.
    - can also be used to let the player know that something important has changed within the game that he will be forced to deal with.
  - establish rules and expectations
    - one of the most important things game narratives can do is help the player understand the rules of the game
    - help establish player objectives
    - set the tone for whatever is coming next
  -
    -
## dialogue
  - dialogue in games serves two main purposes: advancing story and conveying information
  - advancing story
    - learning more about a character
    - creating some interesting reveal
    - setting up a gag that is paid off later
  - dialogue is there to add depth to the story
  -
  -
## elements of plot
  - the plot of the story is an account of the dramatic tension we experienced as a result of the jeopardy our hero faced.
  - the dramatic tension is created by conflict and the stakes that are being contested within our narrative over a set period of time
  - `plot = dramatic tension (conflict x stakes/time = hero jeopardy)`
    - a function of:
      - conflict and stakes,
      - the intensity of both and the time in which it occurs, which generates the risk, or jeopardy a hero faces
      - dramatic tension we experience that forms the basis of the plot of our story
    - how we push and pull the player through a gameplay experience is also the same type of action we want to take when we are driving the narrative forward

  - conflict
    - what is the nature of the fight
    - without conflict there can be no game and no story
    - is the core of any game, and the core of any traditional narrative
    - watching people we care about and are emotionally invested in as they overcome adversity forms the basis of almost all traditional storytelling

  - stakes -
    - what are the stakes that this fight is about
    - this is what we are playing for, both in the game and the story
    - when the stakes increase, the level of dramatic tension intensifies as the jeopardy our hero faces becomes larger
    - the goal is to have the stakes of the story and the stakes of the game in harmony

  - hero jeopardy
    - how do the conflict and stakes put our hero at risk
    - the level of conflict and level of stakes determine the intensity of the jeopardy our hero faces and therefore the dramatic tension that exists withinn the story
    - heavy conflict and high stakes tend to be more serious stories than minor conflict and low stakes
    - comedy - relies on heavy conflict and ligh stakes
    - black comedy - relies on minor conflict and heavy stakes

  - dramatic tension
    - what are the results of the conflict and the stakes and how do they impact our characters

  - time
    - over what time period does this conflict take place
    - the ticking clock drives aaction
    - time establishes the rules under which the characters in the story function
    - conflict and stakes can escalate over time
    - stakes tend to go up when there is less time to finish goals
    - time can heal wounds or aggravate them, causing them to grow even deeper
    - you can speed up/slow down time to create tension

### types of conflict
  - man vs man
    - protagonist versis antagonist
    - hero versis villain
    - can be personal, or just business
    - almost all stories rely on this type of conflict
  - man vs nature
    - hero is trapped in the wilderness, or fighting to survive in a storm, or out to kill the great while whale.
    - nature can also include aliens and monstoers (of biological origin)
  - man vs self
    - hero at war with his own demons, such as addictions and phobias
  - man vs destiny (luck)
    - protagonist battling with his destiny
  - man vs machine
    - man in conflict with technology
  - man vs system
    - hero versus the world
    - e.g. a loner who knows the truth but cant get anyone to believe him
  - man vs past
    - hero is trying to escape his past but it keeps coming back to haunt him

### types of stakes
  - life or death
    - the highest of stakes
    - when you are playing for your life, things are about as serious as they get
  - wealth or poverty
    - greed is powerful motivator and is something that is understandable by everyone
  - love or loss
    - this is more esoteric and isnt used in games as much as it should be
    - it is the most emotional of stakes, and when done properly, love is problably the most compelling emotion
  - happiness or sadness
    - who doesnt strive to be happy
    - if our character starts at the bottom emotionally, his or her journey to happiness can be rewarding for us as well.
  - triumph or defeat
    - win the battle, win the war.
  - security vs instability
    - bringing chaos under control, or succumbing to outside forces
    -
# role playing
  - its about moving whoe worlds around in your brain, which at one time was called the ultimate personal computer
    - in rle playing you become somebody you werent, a hero or a villain, in a world that didnt exist
    - it works because each participant, each player in the game becomes a content creator within the context of the game
    -
